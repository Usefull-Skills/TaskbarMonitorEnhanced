# Current public release summary — R285 / official v1.7.7 (2026-10-17)

Official immutable [v1.7.7 release](https://github.com/GOD13emad/TaskbarMonitorEnhanced/releases/tag/v1.7.7), ID 415382091, source commit dc68cf448173bd0808d1dfa54bc9e9bf7ca20aad. Single intentionally unsigned Setup SHA256 395AEE56006F55FD5DCCFB52E1519088CE01A10386840D7008C6BA900136A06D; shipped/owner Main SHA256 A6D4BFD00C918C0601A12D185F414E92F2B6A85927042B811537B0BC37606253. Exactly seven public assets independently re-downloaded against Manifest, SHA256SUMS and G16. This verifies content/publication, **not** independent malware certification.

**Interruption bug fixed:** Real old v1.7.6 Setup process was killed during rollback on a disposable Windows guest; the retry failed due to abandoned owned .restore scratch. Versioned 1.7.7 safely recovers only known updater-owned transient scratch after verifying the journal/index and old snapshots. Exact-main [Build 38965519302](https://github.com/GOD13emad/TaskbarMonitorEnhanced/actions/runs/38965519302) PASS 27 steps; [hosted native Windows A/B 38965519445](https://github.com/GOD13emad/TaskbarMonitorEnhanced/actions/runs/38965519445) PASS including a real Setup-process kill in guest B. Real AC mains interruption was not tested and has been **excluded by the owner**.

**Actual owner system:** The verified existing v1.7.6 per-user installation was updated in place with the official 1.7.7 Setup, Exit 0, and launched again. A preupgrade 26-file SHA-verified protected backup was preserved; exact five build-output hashes, one Main/one Supervisor/two Brokers, one HKCU registration, no extra HKLM install and cleared journal were verified. Glass true zero background alpha, red threshold warning settings and Windows notification preference remain enabled. v1.7.7 log records a real CPU 95°C warning dispatch at configured 85°C; direct actual OS banner/audio was **not independently witnessed**. Earlier R276 physical red pixels were verified on v1.7.6, and current behavior is retained by compiled regression/owner settings; no false claim of a new v1.7.7 physical pixel count.

**Scope and residual limits:** [Reporter WinRing0 issue #6](https://github.com/GOD13emad/TaskbarMonitorEnhanced/issues/6) still needs original file SHA256/install source, and a signed local PawnIO version does not dismiss that separate reporter warning. Publisher signing is intentionally waived. One **per-user** installation is accepted; no machinewide global singleton/auto-login claim. Audible alert observation remains missing. Physical AC tests are not a required gate.

The owner-local Index/Brain remains the single operational authority. This public page and [Issue #7](https://github.com/GOD13emad/TaskbarMonitorEnhanced/issues/7) are redacted mirrors; older engineering records following this block are preserved unchanged.

## Historical engineering records — prior "CURRENT" headings are not current release claims

# CURRENT R56 — real Start/Search 24/24 PASS; active Native ShellBeacon contract corrected, exact CI/host retest pending

R54 exact source de6d2bb3025b551dabfd0bd792fb368a1d6f519c, 12 candidate gates plus 4 Stable blockers. R55 actual installed-path Main-only guarded seven-minute watchdog test on Emad with real CPU/RAM/GPU/network showed 2895 actual text and 2695 graph pixels. Full resident eight-case suite got 7 PASS: startup, hover, hardware, temperature, protected sensor health, support and START. START met 24/24 SearchHost real shell, 24/24 exact 60px safe float and actual per-frame glyph+chart ink, minimum 48647 foreground signal, ≥1492 text and 1625 chart changed pixels, exact native HWND return to taskbar with legible ink. Eighth ShellState FAIL DIRECT_CHILD_NOT_FOUND: stale child-only proof, expected since true-alpha 0–99% uses a top-level popup. R55 original public installed v1.6 exe/config hashes restored exact, old process running, personal Slideshow and AnyDesk protected; genuine 7/8 FAIL retained. R56 source ShellState now distinguishes real PID-owned native top-level layered/noactivate popup vs 100% opaque taskbar child; native PArgb active beacon performs synchronous real ULW upload, requires magenta/green ≥100 physical pixels and BOTH reset below100, plus real signal≥300, style/PID/geometry/uncloak. Code builds locally, actual installed eight-case retest and exact source CI pending. All external Stable gates still OPEN: approved real Picture WallpaperStudio positive apply/restore, complete installed v1.7 Setup incl Explorer/sensors/8/8 and rollback, public-trusted Authenticode, main+immutable release. Public version v1.6.0 immutable. User Slideshow mode2 untouched, SAEID host declined, no security bypass. Authority docs/project-control/R56_SHELL_BEACON_NATIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md and R54/R51/R49/R46 history, cumulative Brain R38–R55. Project weighted completion UNPROVEN.

# CURRENT R54 — real visible Windows 11 Start/Search glass and exact taskbar return (private candidate)

Parent accepted source SHA R51 0a706f700e4623c24c6cd4e622ac071dcf5f6073. New draft feature branch feature/v1.7.0-r53-start-compositor-visibility. R52 actual installed-path v1.7 alpha-zero popup had visible live CPU/RAM and 2901 text / 2407 microchart pixels but 0/24 pixels during Start, shell foreground 24/24 and cached HWND valid 24/24. R53 actual production OverlayForm experiments: reassert TopMost/demote-promote/native ULW 0/24 visible; temporary exact 60px lift above taskbar 6/6 visible RIGHT and 6/6 LEFT; same HWND Hide/Show after exit restores ink, new HWND also restores but unnecessary. R54 production StartGuardTick now temporarily floats the existing noactivate PArgb strip exactly height+12px above original gap while Start foreground and reverses it via same HWND Hide/Show. R54 native proof exact developer Main SHA 15CB0E5A5F5FB72C1D5D23D7055D550CB8231EDB0B538F2F94F196838A551360: Start shell 24/24, safe lifted geometry 24/24, text+chart 24/24, original geometry restored with 2291 glyphs and 1907 chart pixels. R54-F1 original rescanned taskbar gaps during Start closing causing shifted x=2210 vs original x=2242 and fail; fixed to restore exact cached original rect and defer placement scan until settled. R54-F2 500ms visibility watchdog might immediately rescan if lastTaskbarScreenRect cleared; fixed to preserve cached taskbar screen bounds until routine scan. Strict production StartProbe now requires popup at exact lifted 60px position, shell foreground >=18/24, 24/24 real native ink incl ≥100 changed text and ≥100 changed chart pixels per frame, unchanged PID/style/uncloaked, and exact visible taskbar return. For opacity100 / High Contrast original direct-child rule preserved. Release hard source gate now G12 separate exact Main SHA-bound real 24-screen-ink proof; source candidate expected 12/12 and four external Stable blockers now G13–G16. **Installed full eight runtime/Explorer rollback NOT yet accepted; unsigned public v1.7 NOT released.** Active personal Windows Slideshow mode2, v1.6 installed public Main/config SHA protected; no alternate SAEID PC; no Windows security bypass. Important UX change: a 48px overlay temporarily ABOVE taskbar while Start open; public acceptance of transient UX not separately confirmed. Authority docs/project-control/R54_START_FLOATING_NATIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md, build/Test-Release-Gates.ps1, Project Brain R38–R51 cumulative preserved. Whole project percent UNPROVEN.

# CURRENT R51 - actual native live microcharts pass; Start probe corrected for native window mode

R49 normal-app binary-only installed-path canary on Emad R50 produced 3174 real text and 2898 real chart pixels after real data commits, user v1.6 original exe/config and protection restored with independently verified rollback PASS. Native rendering previously R47/R48 failed zero charts, source R49 fixed by immediate PArgb upload on CommitMetricsSnapshot. R50 six of eight interactive probes passed but Start probe failed BEFORE checking Start because it hard-coded a direct Shell_TrayWnd child even for 0% alpha. R51 StartProbe now strictly validates PID, WS_POPUP, no WS_CHILD, layered noactivate, uncomposited and full taskbar bounds for alpha below 100%; 100% or high contrast retains direct-child requirement. Original Start >=18/24 shell observations, 24/24 HWND/geometry, 300 pixel ink and zero hidden/cloaked thresholds remain unchanged. R51 source 10/10 visual and 5/5 portable pass, exact freeze/CI + real installed-path eight-case retest pending. Public/installed v1.6 remains accepted, user Slideshow type2 protected, no SAEID test. Four Stable blockers remain trusted Wallpaper real static Picture positive canary, actually installed full Setup+Explorer/8 interactive, public Authenticode, approved main CI and immutable release. Brain R45/R46/R49 history retained, see docs/project-control/R51_STARTPROBE_REAL_WINDOW_MODE.md. Full FINAL unproven.

# CURRENT R49: metric-driven native glass refresh, real installed-path acceptance pending

Source branch feature/v1.7.0-r49-live-metric-glass-refresh, R46 parent b1c5ae23876ce88ca63b46e5468342d79ab49b90. R47 and R48 actual (not proof-mode) temporary EXE-in-installed-location tests FAILED: alpha0 text visible (2844 and 2821 real pixels) but chart 0 and CPU/RAM stayed zero even after 65s; R48 6/8 interactive probes PASS with Start FAIL, shell not reached. Both mandatory rollback scripts restored resident v1.6 main/config exact SHA; user Slideshow, signed sensor supervisor and AnyDesk untouched. R47 original wrapper falsely labelled rollback unresolved from unset LASTEXITCODE; independent reconciliation verified rollback PASS. R49 source explicitly re-renders/updates native PArgb glass on every CommitMetricsSnapshot, not relying on unreliable WS_EX_LAYERED WM_PAINT, and theme switches; proof-mode real native form ran 2/2 actual metric-driven uploads, 2206 glyph/1833 chart pixels PASS. 10 visual and 5 portable source developer suites PASS. Exact-source clean-clone and hosted CI plus new installed-location transient canary remain mandatory. Do not call disposable proof-mode success installed production success. All original R38-R46 and R47/R48 failures preserved. Public installed immutable latest v1.6.0. Stable gates G12 positive static Wallpaper, G13 installed 8/8/Explorer, G14 public Authenticode, G15 main + public assets remain BLOCKED. No SAEID use, no wallpaper change or security bypass. R49 authoritative doc: docs/project-control/R49_LIVE_METRIC_REFRESH_VERIFICATION.md. Final project progress UNPROVEN.

# CURRENT R46 - ACTUAL WINDOWS 11 ZERO-ALPHA TEXT AND CHART VISIBLE / UNRELEASED CANDIDATE

Exact parent R45 a019ee72e676c8fa2f3cdd1d5ac28f9b0f1060cf. New isolated candidate branch feature/v1.7.0-r46-native-visible-glass. R46 root cause: layered child UpdateLayeredWindow returning success did not mean its ink was visible above Windows 11 taskbar shell compositor; production-style child with WS_EX_COMPOSITED gave error 87; without WS_EX_COMPOSITED the child had zero actual on-screen text and chart pixels. R46 switches all opacity below 100% to taskbar-anchored no-activate top-level PArgb glass and keeps 100%/High Contrast original opaque child. Preserves UIAutomation safe gap, real metrics and original mouse/menu. User slideshow and installed v1.6 untouched. Actual PRODUCTION OverlayForm disposable proof-mode measured 2,319 real text and 2,055 graph changed pixels at 0%, and no changed fully transparent backdrop pixels; native mode transitions 0-30-97-100-0 PASS (four stages). Exact Main SHA FEF4FC84B06906D6DDAAB5D59EB0BA5A9B339130A42161B8467E2A13766795B3 in preliminary source; source freeze and exact CI still pending. R46 independent candidate release gate requires exact executable SHA, actual real screenshot foreground ink, 4/4 native mode changes, and no host mutation; 15 total candidate+stable gates once committed. Public/installed latest v1.6 immutable. Four Stable blockers remain authorized static Picture wallpaper canary, actual installed v1.7/sensor/Explorer/8 runtime+rollback, public Authenticode, approved main+immutable release. Do not run setup or change personal Windows Slideshow. R46 authority: docs/project-control/R46_NATIVE_COMPOSITOR_VERIFICATION.md and previous R44/R45 lifecycle records. SUPERSEDED: prior child-only ULW API proof or top-level render-only preview as production-visible acceptance. Whole-project percentage UNPROVEN without approved weights.

# R45-F4 RELEASE GATE CORRECTION - NOT PUBLIC FINAL
CI run 38050088052 recorded all five portable child proofs PASS but the GitHub workflow failed due invalid PowerShell comparison of null LASTEXITCODE with zero. Source correction removed only the false wrapper guard and preserves thrown errors and exact 5/5 summary. Exact source CI retest pending. All stable blockers remain: positive wallpaper canary, installed 8/8 runtime, public signing, main release. v1.6 and user slideshow unchanged. See R45_RELEASE_GATE_ENFORCEMENT.md.

---

# R45 CURRENT-CORRECTION - FULL CI FAILED THEN SCOPE FIXED
GitHub CI run 38049549463 FAILED at health without installed sensor Supervisor (host environment mismatch). On real Emad PC full interactive Start probe FAILED 10/24 shell observations although cached child/screen pixels remained good (minimum 7381). The source has been corrected to require 5/5 portable CI runtime tests while leaving full 8/8 installed-host acceptance a strict Stable prerequisite, plus 10/10 visual. Nothing has been installed or publicly released; local v1.6 and slideshow preserved. See R45_RELEASE_GATE_ENFORCEMENT.md. Next action exact commit/build/CI and honest release-preflight, not production promotion.

# CURRENT R45 - FULL CI VERIFICATION HARDENING (PUBLIC FINAL BLOCKED)

Product TaskbarMonitorEnhanced; branch feature/v1.7.0-r44-chart-foreground, parent R44 commit 3926bfa7b9dddb735e7b79ede1c17632848b44d8. R44 chart foreground alpha0 and real on-Emad noninstalled preview PASS, 49 themes, 10 visual, 8 runtime, 196 graph ink dark/light alpha cases; exact R44 CI and determinism PASS. R45 adds mandatory 10-visual and 8-runtime suite checks in GitHub workflow and a fail-closed 14-gate read-only release evaluator. R45 exact SHA CI has not yet been run at this record. Existing installed/public immutable v1.6.0 Main hash 05F9E069C4598FDAD327A41BF1CA34A1498D022119DB81E09F4B3B091C9BA377; user Slideshow BackgroundType 2 unchanged.

CRITICAL BLOCKS: Issue #7 trusted real static-Picture product Apply+exact restore positive canary missing (Windows Sandbox Application Control HRESULT 0x800711C7); user declined using separate SAEID PC; real installed v1.7 native taskbar/Explorer recovery/config rollback missing; public SignPath Foundation Authenticode not available (Get-AuthenticodeSignature NotSigned); main merge/immutable public v1.7 release not performed. Do NOT bypass protections, alter user's slideshow, replace installed v1.6 or claim Stable based on isolated CI and preview. Whole-project weighted percent UNPROVEN. R45 full roadmap and exact tests: docs/project-control/R45_RELEASE_GATE_ENFORCEMENT.md. Legacy R44/R42/R41/R38 records preserved. Exact next step commit R45 source, run exact build/CI 10+8, strict -RequireStable must fail closed, then cumulative Brain R45.

# CURRENT R44 — foreground charts survive alpha zero, candidate only

Source feature/v1.7.0-r44-chart-foreground derives from accepted R42 candidate 5a6c7e5b9537e9694b4447b13e07e86de77b8696. R44 re-routes sparkline, bar, LCD and dot microcharts of all 49 themes into independent glyph-like foreground and high-contrast halo. Chart ON/OFF with dark/light Windows taskbars at zero and 29%: 196/196 source proof pairs PASS; visual regression 10/10. EMAD-PC verified with temporary nonactivating click-through top-level visual-only preview: 24 real samples, 1,788 separate chart pixels, screenshot and automatic close PASS. No deployed production app replaced. Previous public/installed v1.6.0 immutable and user's slideshow unchanged. Blockers: R42 positive static wallpaper canary blocked by Windows Sandbox App Control 0x800711C7 (issue #7), installed v1.7 transactional acceptance, external signing trust, and immutable public publication. CI/determinism on R44 SHA still needs final verification. All release stages and evidence: docs/project-control/R44_RELEASE_GATES_CHECKLIST.md. Whole-project completion percentage UNPROVEN; public FINAL not achieved. SUPERSEDED—DO NOT RUN: previous obscured R43 child preview, pre-R44 candidate setup, old unguarded wallpaper apply. Exact next action: commit exact R44, build/determinism + CI, stage candidate Brain, then trusted static Picture canary and installed acceptance.

# CURRENT R42 — SAFETY HARDENING / NOT RELEASED

Active source worktree: C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\.local\r41-work. Branch release/v1.7.0-r42-safety from R41 d14768fb1d1d2110aec5cb7ddb48427d76d85166. Public immutable and installed v1.6.0 remain accepted. New finding: live Windows background mode 2 Slideshow actively rotates its picture; running an unguarded Wallpaper Studio canary on host would cause persistent loss of Slideshow state. R42 safely rejects dynamic modes and records verified SHA-backed static Picture rollback. RED/green app test and real negative host guard PASS; isolated positive static Picture canary, exact build/determinism, CI, installed runtime, main and publication still OPEN. Whole project progress UNPROVEN; no final claim. Authoritative R42 safety record: docs/project-control/R42_WALLPAPER_SAFETY.md. SUPERSEDED—DO NOT RUN: pre-R42 wallpaper setup and negative test wrappers. Existing R41 Brain is STALE until new cumulative ZIP transfer verified. Exact next action: sandbox positive canary, then remaining exact-gate V&V. No host wallpaper edit or v1.7 auto promotion.

---

# CURRENT R41 — GLASS LEGIBILITY VERIFIED CANDIDATE (NOT RELEASED)

Source: isolated branch feature/v1.7.0-glass-legibility, parent 3a0663fb9ed55c77d28ca3ee8d3d928adf1d2e42. Public, installed immutable authority remains v1.6.0 at 1652989b80c5c6d301c6f05818c48c5207fd9b7a. All 49 candidate themes support 0%-100% background alpha without fading glyphs. At <=30% glyph ink switches to high-contrast black/white from off-overlay actual taskbar RGB samples, with contrasting outline, 4s refresh/fallback; Windows High Contrast forces opaque. No cloud/screen capture. Native actual taskbar child probe five modes PASS, RGB #132A27, contrast 15.13. Pixel proof 196/196, visual suites 9/9, full build 0 warning/error, setup 26/26. Main/Broker/Supervisor sensor source unchanged.

DoD for THIS FEATURE: implementation/build/finite contrast/native-host/48+1 themes PASS. Exact-commit determinism and CI pending. Whole v1.7 (including untested independent live wallpaper canary and installed acceptance) is NOT FINAL. Roadmap: discovery/definition/baseline/development DONE; verification partially passed; validation candidate only; delivery/closure OPEN. Completed: code, tests and canonical package, preserved prior public baseline. Open Critical Gates: exact source commit, clean-clone reproducibility, CI/provenance, R40 wallpaper canary, installed-runtime acceptance, final release. Current/authoritative files: src/TaskbarGlass.cs, altered src/TaskbarMonitorEnhanced.cs and StudioThemes.cs, build files, installer and versioned R41 controls. SUPERSEDED—DO NOT RUN: pre-R41 v1.7 setup as current R41 candidate, and initial proof wrappers with parent-handle/arg/count failures. Do not delete historical files. Exact next action: commit/freeze current R41 source, rerun clean-clone determinism, CI, then recheck release gates. Brain status: INCOMPLETE until cumulative transfer zip verified; previous history below remains append-only historical reference.

# CURRENT PRODUCT AUTHORITY - v1.6.0 RELEASED / R38

UTC 2026-10-02T23:15:56.337123+00:00. Current product: **Taskbar Monitor Enhanced v1.6.0**, eight workspace pages and 48 built-in themes (20 original Studio geometries). Public release402214671 is immutable/latest, with seven verified assets. Source/tag authority `1652989b80c5c6d301c6f05818c48c5207fd9b7a`; canonical root `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced`; installed configuration preserved bit-for-bit (69 properties), exact sensors unchanged. Release and main CI, candidate 15/15 suites, installed 15/15 suites, production UI actions and independent manual UI all passed.

Read `R38_CLOSEOUT.md` and `../acceptance/v1.6.0/PUBLIC_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.json` first. Product lifecycle through delivery/release is complete; no in-scope critical product gate remains. Cumulative transfer archive path is `.local/r38/BRAIN_R38.zip`; its final machine-local receipt and manifest determine archive integrity/account-transfer completion. Post-release documentation is not a new product binary. The historical CURRENT/OPEN/FINAL headings below are preserved verbatim and superseded for current action.

External/deferred only: trusted Authenticode provider, physical two-monitor test, excluded specialist/kernel/plugin/control features. Exact next user action: use the installed app/Theme Studio; do not rerun any installer. Exact engineering continuation: verify newest Brain and immutable source identity, then branch a new revision for any new scope.

# CURRENT AUTHORITY - R38 / v1.6.0 finalization

Updated UTC: 2026-10-02T22:43:42.582431+00:00

Canonical development has been consolidated at `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced`, branch `release/v1.6.0-final`, based on corrected source `182c4ed11d78fa3c52f8bbf104a7e791cd2491bf`. The isolated worktree and original candidate are retained as historical lineages, not current execution roots. Scope is eight workspace pages and 48 themes (20 new original geometries), preserving locked sensors and configuration.

A regression-first cold-shutdown traffic data-loss repair passed all three contract suites (red operation `920abe69-1532-43d2-a0e4-36966e90f094`, green operation `36c6d7b0-83ce-401c-808e-3e6c11c4bc0d`). See `R38_FINALIZATION.md` for failure class/root cause, exact guards, baseline hashes, roadmap, exclusions and next action.

Stage: VERIFICATION / exact source freeze. Full build/determinism, fresh UI/runtime, CI/provenance, configuration-preserving final installation and public immutable publication remain OPEN. Public v1.5.0 remains the accepted external release until verified v1.6 publication. Control record CURRENT; cumulative transfer ZIP INCOMPLETE until closure packaging. Earlier CURRENT/FINAL headings below are historical and superseded for the active v1.6 release.

# CURRENT CONTINUATION — R37 isolated integration verification

Project: Taskbar Monitor Enhanced. Canonical root is C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced; active verified development is its .local\r37-work linked worktree, branch release/v1.6.0-r37-verified. Previous public authority remains immutable v1.5.0. Original-worktree candidate f170a8a is defective (empty committed StudioThemes.cs) and MUST NOT be installed/published.

Current delta: exact-hash theme recovery; actual runtime ordering/bitrate/lifecycle hooks; schema 0..6 migration; unavailable-data gaps; finite-value guards; coalescing traffic writer with corrupt-file preservation; truthful live-data workspace proof. See R37_VERIFICATION.md for failures, evidence and rollback.

Verification checkpoint: operation 18619848-e151-4327-8a31-b9e617c7f0ff passed build with 0 warnings/errors and all three contract suites. Additional model-regression operation 2ffa3f0b-3141-4fd8-b84e-9354d6008c08 passed: counter baselines/resets/gaps/adapter switches, explicit opt-in, coalesced exact final totals, corrupt-file preservation, 90-day retention, immutable snapshots, P95/finite statistics and transactional allowlisted profile import. Actual-data workspace proof 62051440-752f-48b9-8f2b-2bd0fce2a497 captured seven pages with NoSyntheticMetricData=true and 16 live samples; four key pages were visually reviewed. These are candidate verification results, not installed-runtime/public acceptance.

Roadmap now: integration unit/contract verification COMPLETE -> final workspace completeness and UI acceptance -> exact source freeze -> full deterministic build -> CI/provenance -> configuration-preserving live upgrade + installed regression -> immutable publication -> cumulative transfer Brain and closure. Do not infer a whole-project completion percentage.

Locked: sensor sources/protocols unchanged (Broker 1.1.2+r21, Supervisor 1.3.0+r33). No reboot, no public trusted-signature claim, no universal-competitor superiority claim.

Open gates: remaining UI/lifecycle acceptance, source freeze, full build/determinism, CI, actual installed v1.6, publication. Exact next action: commit this repaired checkpoint, finish bounded workspace coverage and independent UI actions, then freeze and run the release gates. Brain status: INCOMPLETE until cumulative transfer ZIP and final gate record are generated. Older CURRENT/FINAL statements below describe historical versions only and are superseded for the active v1.6 candidate.

Setup hash is not final until exact candidate commit rebuild.
- FAILURES / PREVENTION: R37-F1 missing proof helper -> proof-only helper added; R37-F2 malformed canonical-resource Join-Path -> direct paths; R37-F3 harness null Trim and PowerShell automatic $args collision -> invalid prior PASS explicitly rejected, null-safe $arguments harness rerun from fresh evidence and 15/15 PASS.

## CURRENT AUTHORITY - 2026-10-01 R32 DEEP PC AUDIT / CONSOLIDATED ROOT

This section supersedes older Current authority / Current critical gate / Exact next action statements below where they conflict. Historical release acceptance records remain immutable evidence and are not rewritten.

### Authority and scope

- FACT / CONFIRMED: Canonical project root is C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Immutable public release authority remains v1.2.0. The annotated v1.2.0 tag peels to release commit 84d22fae6638b21683ea828e86517d100ced1654. The release remains FINAL_PUBLIC_RELEASE_ACCEPTED; this R32 audit does not mutate that tag or its published assets.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Main/control head immediately before R32 audit-record mutation was f1136bbf0501f37040162db37b85562ce0901378.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Local forensic/history/runtime evidence is consolidated under .local and ignored by Git. Live installed runtime remains at its Windows operational paths because moving it would break the application; a full snapshot and integration-state snapshot are retained under .local\runtime-snapshots\2026-10-01.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Only Emad-PC-Ultimate was used for the machine audit and filesystem mutations.

### Full-PC discovery and consolidation

- FACT / CONFIRMED: A recursive name/path discovery scanned all mounted data volumes C:, D:, and H:. F: existed only as an unmounted drive letter with Test-Path F:\ = false, so it had no readable filesystem to scan.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Pre-consolidation discovery found 6,039 project-related path/name matches. D: contributed no project match; H: contributed five matches.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Phase 1 consolidation moved 2,049 files / 1,229,439,290 bytes from the external project archive, Downloads\My Project\TBME, legacy _rc_tbme helpers, and legacy installers into the canonical root. Independent post-move SHA-256 verification passed 2,049/2,049 with zero mismatches.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Phase 2 consolidation handled 34 source objects / 8,601 files / 3,143,198,410 bytes, including ten inactive self-hosted runner trees, sixteen historical TBME boot workspaces, predecessor taskbar-monitor residue, the SensorBroker crash dump, three H:\My app release artifacts, and safe copies of cross-system/global-backup evidence. Independent post-operation verification passed 8,601/8,601 with zero mismatches.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Four explicit copy-suffixed download duplicates were deleted only after exact SHA-256 canonical counterparts were proven; 368,693 bytes were removed while the pre-move manifest preserves original paths and hashes.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Inactive runner infrastructure contains 7,419 files / 3,060,754,534 logical bytes. Windows LZX archive compression processed 7,293 files at about 2.1:1 and freed about 1.53 GB on C:. Full post-compression SHA-256/size verification passed 7,419/7,419 with zero failures.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Post-consolidation full-PC scan found 315 related matches outside the root: 313 on C:, zero on D:, and two on H:. Every remaining match is classified as live runtime/sensor/shortcut, external software cache, global Remote Commander backup, cross-system evidence, or KISH_AI cross-project mirror. No inactive TBME-owned workspace/archive remains unclassified outside the root.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Razer cache items and KISH_AI references were copied into the root with hashes while originals were preserved because they belong to other software/projects. The two KISH_AI C:/H: mirrors are pairwise SHA-256 identical.

### Reconstructed project origin and evolution

- FACT / CONFIRMED: Taskbar Monitor Enhanced is a GPL derivative of leandrosa81/taskbar-monitor; attribution is preserved in the tracked repository.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: The enhanced project predates the public Git history. The earliest recovered local package is R9R3 from 2026-08-15 and contains a PowerShell runtime, TaskbarMonitorEnhanced.ps1. Its manifest identifies R8 as baseline and already defines R10/R11/R12/R13 follow-on work.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: The recovered Git repository is now unshallowed. Its root commit is 4307824c4c1cdb3138b81f0fca6019c00439ed2e, dated 2026-08-16T02:00:29+03:30, subject Initial public release: Taskbar Monitor Enhanced 1.0.0.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Public release lineage is v1.0.0 -> V1.0.2 -> v1.1.0 -> v1.1.1 -> v1.1.2 -> v1.1.3 -> v1.2.0.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: Four dangling Git objects discovered after unshallow were preserved before any cleanup: two commits in .local\history\git-dangling\dangling-commits.bundle with bundle verification PASS and two exported blobs. No destructive git gc/prune was performed.

### Current build and functional validation

- FACT / CONFIRMED: Current main builds locally with Build.ps1 -NoDownload: Main, Broker, Supervisor, and Setup all compile with 0 warnings / 0 errors; windowless sensor PE, canonical text payload, and reproducible-build gates PASS.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: dependency lock is intact. LibreHardwareMonitor 0.9.6 and PawnIO 2.2.0 cached artifacts exactly match dependencies.lock.json SHA-256 values. GitHub release metadata checked from Emad PC reports both pinned versions as latest stable as of this audit.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: corrected R32 safe-proof harness produced 121 evidence artifacts and 8 PASS / 1 FAIL: selftest, hover-guard, 8-page Settings, 28-theme proof, compact 592/500 proof, hardware probe, temperature probe, and real shell/taskbar state PASS. Health probe exits 12 because the live storage lane is degraded.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: real shellstate proof reports WindowValid=true, Visible=true, ParentOk=true, active-beacon PASS, and direct taskbar parenting.
- FACT / CONFIRMED: current binary signing status is NotSigned for Main/Broker/Supervisor/Setup and installed Main/Uninstaller. Public-trust signing remains external/pending.

### Current open technical gates

1. STORAGE SENSOR HEALTH - OPEN / CURRENT RUNTIME BLOCKER FOR FULL-HEALTH CLAIM.
   - FACT: R21 process containment is healthy, CPU and GPU lanes are healthy, but StorageTransportHealthy=false / StorageDataAvailable=false during the R32 health proof.
   - FACT: Supervisor uses a fixed 12-second storage one-shot timeout and requires worker process exit before accepting success.
   - FACT: storage broker logs show valid BROKER_ONCE_PASS/data can occur near the timeout boundary, while Supervisor can still classify the attempt TIMEOUT and enter 180/300-second backoff. Later attempts sometimes fail to reach BROKER_ONCE_PASS before timeout.
   - FACT: the storage JSON has demonstrated valid readings for all three SSDs, while Main correctly marks disk temperature unavailable when that data becomes stale.
   - INFERENCE / HIGH CONFIDENCE: the failure is a one-shot completion/exit-latency contract problem around LibreHardwareMonitor storage teardown/worker termination plus an overly tight 12-second Supervisor budget, not inability to discover the disks.
   - EXACT NEXT ENGINEERING ACTION: R32-1 must change storage acceptance so fresh validated output is not discarded merely because process exit lags near the timeout, define a measured timeout/hysteresis policy, reap lingering workers safely, and add slow-exit/timeout/backoff regression tests.

2. GPU NVML DRIVER-TRANSITION CRASH - CONTAINED / HARDENING GATE.
   - FACT: on 2026-09-30 at 14:56:55 the isolated SensorBroker terminated with AccessViolationException in LibreHardwareMonitor NvidiaML.NvmlDeviceGetPowerUsage / nvml.dll.
   - FACT: Windows UserPnp events at 14:56:53-14:56:54 show NVIDIA display-driver services being re-added for the same RTX 3080 immediately before the crash.
   - FACT: the crashing NVML was version 8.17.16.1656; current NVML is 8.17.16.1714 and the old DriverStore copy is no longer present.
   - FACT: GPU broker recovered to READY within seconds and Main remained operational; no other TBME Application/.NET crash was found from the v1.2.0 release window through this audit.
   - INFERENCE / HIGH CONFIDENCE: the incident is strongly correlated with an NVIDIA driver transition/update, while exact culpability between driver/NVML and LHM call timing remains unproven.
   - PROPOSAL: add a display-driver-transition regression lane and bounded GPU worker quarantine/backoff around repeated native faults; do not weaken process isolation.

3. START-WITH-WINDOWS REDUNDANCY - LIVE STATE REPAIRED / CODE GAP OPEN.
   - FACT: config had StartWithWindows=true and the recovery Startup shortcut was valid, but the primary HKCU Run value was absent at audit start.
   - FACT: startup logs did not show a STARTUP_RUN write error at the current Main start, so the later remover is unproven.
   - FACT: StartupManager repairs registrations only when a new primary instance reaches SetEnabled; a recovery invocation exits early if an existing primary is already running. There is no continuous registration watchdog.
   - FACT: R32 preserved prestate, removed the orphan predecessor taskbar-monitor StartupApproved entry, restored the exact expected TaskbarMonitorEnhanced HKCU Run value, and verified poststate PASS.
   - PROPOSAL: bounded periodic self-check/repair while StartWithWindows=true, with explicit tests for deletion after startup.

4. PUBLIC TRUST SIGNING - OPEN EXTERNAL GATE.
   - FACT: v1.2.0 is functionally/public-release accepted but remains unsigned. SignPath/public-trust acceptance is not proven.
   - PROPOSAL: complete an external trusted signing provider workflow only for a newly versioned release or a release whose exact published artifact was already signed before publication; never rewrite immutable historical assets.

5. MAINTAINABILITY / TEST ARCHITECTURE - DEBT, NOT CURRENT RELEASE BLOCKER.
   - FACT: src\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced.cs is approximately 7,638 lines and centralizes many UI, telemetry, update, proof, and configuration responsibilities.
   - FACT: no xUnit/NUnit/MSTest project was found; quality assurance is dominated by built-in CLI proofs, deterministic build gates, and integration/runtime acceptance.
   - PROPOSAL: after R32-1 runtime health, split high-risk subsystems behind testable interfaces and add focused unit tests while retaining existing end-to-end proofs.

### Current status and critical path

- Historical v1.2.0 release acceptance: PRESERVED / IMMUTABLE.
- Repository/build integrity: PASS.
- PC-wide project consolidation: PASS.
- Current UI/taskbar/CPU/GPU operation: PASS at audit time.
- Current full sensor-health claim: FAIL / DEGRADED because storage lane is in timeout/backoff.
- Current public trusted signing: PENDING EXTERNAL PROVIDER.
- Critical path: R32-1 Storage completion/timeout contract -> R32-2 startup continuous self-heal -> GPU driver-transition hardening -> maintainability/test decomposition. Public trusted signing is a parallel external gate.
- Exact next action: implement and validate R32-1 without mutating v1.2.0 tag/assets; require build, selftest, storage fault/slow-exit regression, live health PASS, and downstream CPU/GPU/taskbar regression before promotion.

- Exact next action: none for v1.1.2. Any future change starts a new maintenance/release scope; do not move or overwrite tag v1.1.2.
## Project definition

Taskbar Monitor Enhanced is a Windows taskbar-integrated hardware/system monitor. R21 hardens the product for long-run daily use: isolated native hardware-sensor access, bounded self-healing, windowless protected sensor workers, least-privilege Main UI, deterministic builds, auditable supply-chain provenance and safe installation/update behavior.

## Final Objective / DoD

Release immutable public v1.1.2 only when the exact final source/build/install identity has:
- zero-warning/zero-error reproducible build and clean-clone byte determinism;
- pinned LibreHardwareMonitor/PawnIO dependency hashes and SPDX SBOM;
- Main at Medium integrity with no LibreHardwareMonitor loaded in Main;
- protected Broker/Supervisor in Program Files, windowless PE GUI subsystem, correct Job containment and scheduled-task policy;
- truthful CPU/GPU/storage telemetry with 15-second UI freshness;
- bounded recovery from transient sensor stalls without restart storms and a hard watchdog for true stalls;
- real S3 suspend/resume acceptance with no false freshness failure;
- taskbar geometry/module/EventLog/runtime soak acceptance;
- exact GitHub provenance/SBOM attestations and immutable release assets;
- clean Start Menu/startup/uninstall surface;
- current cumulative Brain and acceptance evidence sufficient for account transfer.

## Roadmap and current position

Lifecycle:
DISCOVERY → DEFINITION → BASELINE → DEVELOPMENT → VERIFICATION → **VALIDATION/ACCEPTANCE (CURRENT)** → DELIVERY/RELEASE → CLOSURE → FINAL

Evidence-backed completed:
1. R21 architecture/process isolation and protected sensor boundary.
2. Deterministic build pipeline, dependency lock, SBOM generator, self-hosted attestations.
3. Main taskbar/UI feature baseline and module isolation.
4. RC7 transient output-observation-gap fix and windowless Broker/Supervisor.
5. RC8 least-privilege Main launch boundary.
6. RC9 official Windows suspend/resume notification integration.
7. RC9 deterministic Setup canonical text staging.
8. RC9 installer single-instance/state-integrity hardening.
9. RC9 real S3 test: physical suspend/wake occurred; resume notification observed; no worker failure during resume; post-health PASS.
10. RC10 source/build/determinism/SBOM/self-hosted GitHub supply-chain gates.

Current critical gate:
**Obtain a new explicit administrator-consent approval, then install exact protected RC10 pair and execute fault-injection/runtime acceptance.**

Remaining after RC10 protected install:
- 25-second soft-stall fault injection: no CPU restart; UI freshness remains truthful; same worker recovers.
- >60-second hard-stall fault injection: hard watchdog must restart stuck CPU worker and recover.
- post-fault runtime soak with stable restart counters and zero new failures.
- real S3 regression on installed RC10.
- taskbar/module/EventLog/windowless/integrity regressions on installed RC10.
- update acceptance/Brain to RC10 accepted state.
- derive exact final v1.1.2 identity from accepted RC10, rebuild/determinism/install/attest/revalidate and only then publish immutable Stable/Latest.

## Current installed state — IMPORTANT

The attempted protected RC10 elevation reached Windows Secure Desktop, but Windows returned **"The operation was canceled by the user."** Per fail-closed policy it was not automatically retried.

A transactional rollback was then completed with the exact accepted RC9 Setup:
- RC9 Setup SHA-256: `48DADB48072344E4627A939971313B931E84365A0311F79E48FC793BB029CBC8`.
- installed Main: `911D5F6303BB6CBA48FB1D9651B4CADB541A62BB6781E57312FEA52E913AE59D`.
- installed Broker: `5D4824409E34794467340741A88EE0B1EC390ADE9F090D33B5746DD92081CB9C`.
- installed Supervisor: `A0A7C711BEC1F920DB8107E4700FCA886EF7E6869E987546D0938DBEA69DFDB5`.
- `install_state.json`: `1.1.2-rc9 / READY / CURRENT_EXACT_RC9`.
- post-rollback HealthProbe: `PASS / STABLE / ActiveConsecutiveFailures=0`.
- runtime tree: 1 Supervisor, 2 persistent Brokers, 0 sensor-owned console children.
- no Setup orphan remains.

Therefore the user's live machine is back on the last accepted runtime baseline and is **not left degraded**. RC10 remains a development candidate whose exact protected installation requires a new explicit future administrator consent before runtime/fault-injection acceptance can proceed.

## Why RC10 exists

After RC9's real-S3 resume race was fixed, a post-S3 90-second soak found a separate recurring CPU sensor stall:
- `17:55:35Z WORKER_FAILURE CPU STALE_OUTPUT_16.0S`
- `17:56:12Z WORKER_FAILURE CPU NO_CURRENT_OUTPUT_AFTER_GRACE`
- recovery at `17:57:41Z`.

Broker log showed no `BROKER_FATAL`; the worker stayed alive and was likely blocked in LibreHardwareMonitor/PawnIO hardware access. An isolated 8-case CPU/storage contention probe did not reproduce a timeout, so simple storage concurrency is UNPROVEN. Active MSI Center/Mystic Light services are a possible external contention source but are not proven root cause and must not be disabled automatically.

Windows ACPI thermal-zone fallback was rejected: available ACPI temperature was not representative of CPU Package temperature.

RC10 therefore separates data freshness from process-watchdog policy:
- UI/Main CPU temperature freshness remains **15 seconds**; stale data becomes unavailable/N/A.
- CPU Supervisor hard-stall budget is **60 seconds**.
- CPU startup grace is **60 seconds**.
- GPU keeps the established 15-second hard behavior.
- soft CPU stalls are observable via `CpuSlowOutputActive` / `WORKER_SLOW_OUTPUT`;
- recovery logs `WORKER_SLOW_OUTPUT_RECOVERED`;
- true >60s stalls still cause bounded restart.

This avoids hiding stale telemetry while reducing restart storms caused by transient low-level sensor delays.

## Verification state

RC10 PASS:
- App/Broker/Supervisor/Setup: 0 warnings / 0 errors.
- Main self-test: PASS, includes `CPU_HARD_STALL_WATCHDOG_SEC=60`.
- Setup resource/policy verify: PASS.
- Sensor PE windowless guard: PASS.
- Canonical text payload gate: PASS.
- Clean-clone byte determinism: PASS.
- SPDX 2.3 SBOM generation: PASS.
- GitHub self-hosted run `35460297804`: SUCCESS.
- GitHub steps build/determinism/SBOM/provenance/Setup-SBOM/evidence-upload: SUCCESS.
- RC10 draft evidence assets uploaded; public release not promoted.

RC10 UNPROVEN/PENDING:
- exact protected RC10 install;
- soft/hard watchdog fault injection;
- post-fault soak;
- real S3 on installed RC10;
- final installed RC10 taskbar/module/EventLog regression;
- final public v1.1.2 identity/release.

## Historical failure / prevention record

- RC6 false `NO_CURRENT_OUTPUT_AFTER_GRACE`: single transient missing file observation triggered restart. Prevention: last-known-good freshness handling; regression protects short gaps.
- RC7 CUI console window: Scheduled Task launched console-subsystem Supervisor. Prevention: Broker/Supervisor WinExe + PE subsystem build guard.
- RC8 elevation inheritance: whole elevated Setup could auto-launch high-integrity Main. Prevention: elevated Setup never auto-launches Main; normal Setup keeps Main Medium integrity.
- RC8 real-S3 race: stale GPU evaluation occurred before long-gap detection. Prevention: Windows suspend/resume callback plus transition deferral; RC9 physical S3 passed.
- RC9 Setup determinism: raw CRLF/LF text resources changed Setup bytes across checkout policies. Prevention: canonical UTF-8/LF embedded-text staging.
- RC9 installer state race: parallel Setup invocations could delete shared sensor result and write DEGRADED after successful helper. Prevention: single-instance Setup mutex + unified sensor version constant.
- RC9 post-S3 CPU stalls: recurring ~15s LHM/PawnIO CPU read stalls caused restarts. RC10 prevention under validation: 15s data freshness, 60s CPU hard watchdog.
- Do not disable MSI Center/Mystic Light or other unrelated user services without separate evidence/approval.

## Authoritative vs superseded

Authoritative/current:
- branch `audit/r21-final-hardening-rc10`
- commit `e89aebd9012f95d050771283562069f9cb5f5515`
- `build/Build-R21.ps1`
- `build/Verify-Determinism.ps1`
- `build/Generate-Sbom.ps1`
- `.github/workflows/r21-rc10-selfhosted-finalize.yml`
- `RC_MANIFEST_v1.1.2-rc10.json`
- `SHA256SUMS_v1.1.2-rc10.txt`

SUPERSEDED — DO NOT RUN as current candidate:
- RC6/RC7/RC8/RC9 release workflows, manifests and runners.
They remain historical provenance/evidence only.
- Public v1.1.1 remains valid rollback/stable authority until v1.1.2 is actually accepted and promoted.

## Key evidence

- `r21_evidence/RC9_REAL_SUSPEND_RESUME.json` — RC9 physical S3 PASS.
- `r21_evidence/RC9_POST_S3_SOAK_90S.json` — RC9 CPU-stall failure evidence; must be preserved.
- `r21_evidence/rc9_contention_probe/RC9_SENSOR_CONTENTION_PROBE.json` — simple storage contention not reproduced.
- GitHub RC10 run `35460297804`.
- RC10 draft prerelease and its build manifest/SBOM/evidence ZIP.
- Local cumulative knowledge/evidence under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\00_PROJECT_CONTROL`.

## Risks / hinges

- Windows Secure Desktop UAC is the current owner gate for replacing Program Files protected binaries. The latest consent was canceled by the user; Remote Commander must not automatically retry or bypass that denial.
- LibreHardwareMonitor/PawnIO may experience transient hardware-access stalls on this MSI Z790 environment; RC10 watchdog semantics require real fault-injection and soak proof.
- Public Stable/Latest promotion is irreversible in practice under immutable-release policy; promotion is forbidden until exact final v1.1.2 identity is revalidated.

## Exact next action

1. Provide a new explicit administrator-consent approval for the hash-pinned RC10 Setup. The previous UAC was canceled and will not be retried automatically.
2. Verify installed Broker/Supervisor hashes equal the RC10 manifest and `install_state=READY/CURRENT_EXACT_RC10`.
3. Run RC10 soft-stall and hard-stall fault injections, then post-fault soak.
4. Run real S3 and full installed regressions.
5. If all PASS, record accepted RC10, derive final v1.1.2 identity, rebuild/determinism/install/attest/revalidate, then publish immutable Stable/Latest.

## Account-Transfer Test

PASS for understanding/continuation: a new account can identify project goal, root, current branch/commit, installed mixed state, historical failures, current blocker, release-chain status, remaining gates and exact next action from this Brain alone.

## HISTORY

- v1.1.1: current public stable/rollback authority.
- R21: process-isolated protected sensors, deterministic builds, supply-chain hardening and diagnostics.
- RC7: output-gap and windowless sensor fixes.
- RC8: Main integrity/elevation boundary.
- RC9: official power notification, deterministic Setup and installer state-integrity fixes; real S3 PASS but post-S3 CPU stall recurrence.
- RC10: CPU 15s freshness / 60s hard-stall separation. Build/determinism/SBOM/self-hosted CI PASS; protected-install consent was canceled, live system was rolled back cleanly to accepted RC9, and RC10 runtime validation remains pending.

- 2026-09-26 R22: final v1.1.2 identity equivalence 7/7 PASS; deterministic build/SBOM PASS; exact final install PASS with config preserved; proportional runtime R2 PASS after correcting known PowerShell timestamp harness false negative. GitHub publication remains the critical path.


## CI FAILURE / PREVENTION — 2026-09-26 RUN 36244394685

- Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- Failed GitHub run: 36244394685 at control commit 483367af265eae8bd6043c11570f8f6be58531de.
- Failure point: Git whitespace check before any build or attestation step.
- Exact error: fatal: ambiguous argument HEAD^: unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
- Root cause: actions/checkout defaults to fetch-depth 1, while the next step requires parent commit HEAD^.
- Prevention: keep the pinned checkout action and add only fetch-depth: 2, the minimum history required by the official actions/checkout HEAD^ scenario.
- Regression: a fresh push run must pass whitespace, build, determinism, SBOM, provenance, Setup-SBOM and evidence upload; downloaded artifact hashes must match the already accepted final hashes.
- The failed run is not rerun blindly. Critical path remains GitHub attestation -> immutable v1.1.2 publication -> final closeout.

- 2026-09-26 R22 FINAL: v1.1.2 published and post-verified as immutable Latest/Stable at aab35e5e0e3420f3b21e8febe49bc9e2cc8bb8c0; 8/8 release assets digest/size verified; no open DoD gate.

## CURRENT MAINTENANCE — R23 DEVELOPMENT CODE SIGNING

This maintenance scope does not modify the immutable v1.1.2 release.

- Branch: maintenance/code-signing.
- Development Authenticode identity: CN=Taskbar Monitor Enhanced Development Code Signing.
- Thumbprint: 4673165CCB579F868EFE5F52FCDA761780F49989.
- Certificate: RSA / sha256RSA / Code Signing EKU.
- Private key: CurrentUser\My only; not exported and not committed.
- Public certificate SHA256: 217EC08DF0C2A23F9AEB3925FA40D7561FC21DE61039458514067FAAC0753A10.
- Signing probe: PASS on an evidence copy only; signed probe SHA256 65168AD41EAA0C5B562FACE9E3DDEBACDA9EBC38606C94C42D4E9C55AA6AAFCD.
- Verification negative tests: unsigned file rejected; tampered signed copy rejected.
- Windows trust result: UnknownError because the self-signed development root is not publicly trusted. This is expected and is not presented as Trusted Publisher status.
- Immutable v1.1.2 Setup remains 25744A0A0F78B787A5FC3601577748B80353ADC9DAFB9FE91A111A53C56216FB; tag remains aab35e5e0e3420f3b21e8febe49bc9e2cc8bb8c0.
- Development signing tooling supports SHA256 Authenticode and optional RFC3161 timestamping.
- Public-trust blocker: obtain a CA-issued Code Signing certificate or approved managed signing identity.
- Exact next action for a publicly trusted signed release: use the CA identity to sign binaries before packaging, sign/timestamp installer last, regenerate hashes/SBOM/attestation and publish a NEW version. Never rewrite v1.1.2.

## CURRENT MAINTENANCE — R24 PUBLIC-TRUST SIGNING READINESS

This section supersedes R23 as the current maintenance authority where they conflict. Immutable public v1.1.2 remains unchanged.

- Working branch: `maintenance/signpath-readiness`, based on accepted R23 commit `41963f94013ecb8745897839ccc6e9b220be5d71`.
- Public-trust route selected: SignPath Foundation open-source signing application. Acceptance is external and PENDING; no release is claimed SignPath-signed.
- Repository is public; GitHub account `GOD13emad` has 2FA enabled.
- Root license declaration remains GPL-3.0-or-later; truncated root LICENSE was replaced with the already-accepted full GNU GPL v3 text without changing the declared license family.
- README and DOWNLOAD now expose the exact Code signing policy terminology, required SignPath provider attribution, privacy link, immutable-release rule, and explicit install/uninstall instructions.
- Actual updater/privacy audit: default HTTPS release check targets GitHub Releases API and can be disabled; installer download requires user confirmation; monitoring telemetry/config/hardware readings are not uploaded to a project-operated service.
- Actual PE metadata gate: PASS for Main, Broker, Supervisor and Setup. ProductName = Taskbar Monitor Enhanced; ProductVersion = 1.1.2+r21; FileVersion = 1.1.2.0; Company/FileDescription populated.
- Actual uninstall gate: PASS from installer source. Windows per-user Installed apps registration includes DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, UninstallString and QuietUninstallString; uninstaller path is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\Uninstall.exe`.
- SignPath application surface: `https://signpath.org/apply.html`, HubSpot portal `145110231`, form `bf62807d-bb72-4e45-9bde-1f3a53ba2472`; browser page loaded and Tagline/Description fields were observed.
- Hard external interaction gate: Remote Commander rejects browser input with `WORKFLOW_GUI_TAKEOVER_REQUIRES_DIRECT_USER_SESSION`. Chat authorization cannot override this platform gate. Application submission therefore remains NOT SUBMITTED.
- Prepared application packet: `docs/security/SIGNPATH_APPLICATION_PACKET.json`, status `READY_TO_SUBMIT_DIRECT_USER_GUI_ACTION_REQUIRED`.
- Immutable release regression remains PASS: tag v1.1.2 -> `aab35e5e0e3420f3b21e8febe49bc9e2cc8bb8c0`; Setup SHA256 `25744A0A0F78B787A5FC3601577748B80353ADC9DAFB9FE91A111A53C56216FB`.
- Publicly trusted signature Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- Current critical path: commit/push readiness docs -> fast-forward default `main` to the accepted readiness commit without force -> verify immutable release -> user/direct-GUI submission of SignPath application -> SignPath Foundation review/acceptance -> create a NEW signed release, never rewrite v1.1.2.

## R24 REPOSITORY-SIDE READINESS CLOSEOUT

- Repository readiness commit: `b6c13838624e99d1d6ba4811b295834e22e45947`.
- `origin/main` and `origin/maintenance/signpath-readiness` were both verified at that commit after an ordinary non-force fast-forward of main.
- GitHub Actions exact run `36250864888` for head SHA `b6c13838624e99d1d6ba4811b295834e22e45947`: COMPLETED / SUCCESS.
- CI job `build`: all steps PASS, including checkout, whitespace, reproducible build, deterministic clean-clone verification, SPDX SBOM generation, binary provenance attestation, Setup SBOM attestation and evidence upload.
- Repository-side SignPath Foundation readiness: PASS.
- External application state: NOT SUBMITTED. Remote Commander browser input is blocked by `WORKFLOW_GUI_TAKEOVER_REQUIRES_DIRECT_USER_SESSION`; this platform gate cannot be bypassed by chat authorization.
- Publicly trusted Authenticode release state: PENDING external SignPath Foundation review/acceptance and a future NEW release. Development self-signed signing remains test-only.
- Immutable public v1.1.2 remains unchanged: tag `aab35e5e0e3420f3b21e8febe49bc9e2cc8bb8c0`, Setup SHA256 `25744A0A0F78B787A5FC3601577748B80353ADC9DAFB9FE91A111A53C56216FB`.
- Exact next action: in a direct user browser session, submit the already-prepared SignPath application using `docs/security/SIGNPATH_APPLICATION_PACKET.json`; after external acceptance, create and validate a separately versioned signed release. Never rewrite v1.1.2.

## R24 FINAL SIGNPATH APPLICATION GATE

- Official application surface re-audited from public SignPath/HubSpot resources: portal `145110231`, form `bf62807d-bb72-4e45-9bde-1f3a53ba2472`, region `eu1`.
- Public render-definition SHA256: `bf122cf482f6887667fb30661e3be8bafdcdac0c15c05c5a79a72f5337aeb570`.
- Exact required fields are known and prepared in `docs/security/SIGNPATH_APPLICATION_PACKET.json`, including Project/Repository/Homepage, Tagline, Description, Reputation, Build System, First/Last Name, Email and Discovery Channel.
- Truthful reputation audit: this new repository currently has 0 stars, 0 forks, 0 subscribers and 0 v1.1.2 release-asset downloads. No adoption claim is made. Declared GPL upstream `leandrosa81/taskbar-monitor` currently has 540 stars, 42 forks and 13 subscribers; those metrics are recorded only as upstream heritage.
- Trust evidence supplied instead of inflated adoption claims: deterministic clean-clone GitHub Actions build, SPDX 2.3 SBOM, GitHub build/SBOM attestations, immutable SHA256 release manifests and documented Windows runtime acceptance.
- Required first-person external attestations identified:
  1. agree to SignPath Foundation Code of Conduct and certificate-revocation terms;
  2. agree to SignPath storage/processing of personal data.
- Optional SignPath marketing consent remains intentionally unchecked unless separately requested.
- Form also contains reCAPTCHA2. It is a human anti-bot control and must not be bypassed or solved programmatically.
- User explicitly authorized mouse/keyboard use in the current chat. ChatGPT app permission for Remote Commander is already `Allow all actions`; server reports GUI mouse/keyboard capability and `explicit-current-request-only`.
- Connector limitation: the tool schema exposed to this ChatGPT session for `gui_session_begin` accepts only `ttlSeconds` and always creates an observe-only lease. The server-side intended takeover parameters (`mode=takeover`, `explicitUserAuthorization`) are not exposed through this session. Direct takeover therefore cannot be acquired; workflow takeover is separately blocked by `WORKFLOW_GUI_TAKEOVER_REQUIRES_DIRECT_USER_SESSION`.
- Security decision: no raw MCP request, SendInput, UIAutomation, Chrome DevTools Protocol or shell-based injection will be used to circumvent the takeover/CAPTCHA gates.
- Official application and Code of Conduct pages were opened on the user's Windows desktop; application page was reopened as the newest browser tab.
- Application Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- Repository-side public-signing readiness remains PASS. Publicly trusted signing remains PENDING SignPath submission/review/acceptance and a future NEW signed release. v1.1.2 remains immutable.
- Exact next action: user must personally attest the two mandatory consent statements and complete reCAPTCHA on the already-open official form. After submission evidence is available, update packet/Brain and proceed with SignPath review/acceptance and a new signed release.

## R25 / v1.1.3 STARTUP RESILIENCE — LOCAL ACCEPTANCE

- Trigger: after a real power-loss/restart event, application configuration still had `StartWithWindows=true` and Windows StartupApproved was enabled, but the actual HKCU Run value `TaskbarMonitorEnhanced` was absent. The protected sensor supervisor still started independently. The exact external remover of the Run value remains UNPROVEN.
- Bootstrap defect in v1.1.2: Main could repair its Run value only after Main was already running; losing the sole Main launch registration therefore prevented self-heal.
- v1.1.3 design: two independent per-user registrations when Start with Windows is enabled:
  1. primary HKCU Run value for immediate launch;
  2. current-user Startup-folder recovery shortcut invoking `--startup-recovery`.
- Recovery behavior: waits up to 12 seconds for the primary launch path, exits early if a primary process exists, otherwise continues normal startup. Existing named mutex remains the final single-instance guard.
- Mutual repair: surviving Run launch recreates a missing recovery shortcut; surviving recovery shortcut launches Main and Main recreates the missing Run value. Disabling Start with Windows removes both. Uninstall source removes both.
- Privilege decision: a Scheduled Task fallback was rejected after a real non-elevated `schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON` probe returned Access Denied. The accepted fallback is per-user Startup-folder based and requires no administrator privilege.
- Code + visual candidate commit: `bcbd8f8e8861e4e4a83350699214f1bb83b1132e`, branch `release/v1.1.3-startup-resilience`, parent `9fcfcd389eea85e2ccbdf03ce6cdfe8b99463e9b`.
- Build identity: `V1_1_3_R22_STARTUP_RESILIENCE`; public version 1.1.3.
- Local build gates: four project builds PASS with 0 warnings / 0 errors; Setup verify PASS; built-in selftest PASS; sensor windowless PE PASS; canonical text payload PASS; SPDX 2.3 SBOM PASS.
- Clean-clone deterministic verification on exact commit `bcbd8f8...`: `R21_REPRO_BUILD=PASS`, `R21_DETERMINISM=PASS`.
- Exact outputs at local acceptance:
  - Main: `74E7725E3C3911EFEDEC1181C21AF07571C9A22CD758EE50E06EA1373DAB7317`
  - Broker: `182D634616434AECADD3A9AF54A746BB61FD70EC0F788DC12429679AA197D833`
  - Supervisor: `38553CCE30D5D3F1A22AC6765C4A0F5D4D204970A3DAD7BA9467A326235FC196`
  - Setup 1.1.3: `159D6995D16A549DAC35BD6EF69543A63D6675778C37012619BEFDABFD43598C`
  - SBOM: `651057410EB57090E1D7ED5EB9522AB8B40284D484CAB0A1C9ADA4DC1833E192`
- Protected sensor layer remains accepted `1.1.2+r21`; exact Broker/Supervisor hashes were unchanged after v1.1.3 install; install state READY / CURRENT_EXACT_1_1_2.
- Live startup fault injection:
  - missing Run -> recovery path -> Run recreated, one Main: PASS;
  - missing recovery shortcut -> normal launch -> shortcut recreated with exact target/argument, one Main: PASS;
  - recovery launch while primary running -> fallback exit 0, same sole primary PID: PASS;
  - StartWithWindows=false -> both registrations absent and app usable; original true setting restored and both registrations returned: PASS.
- Visual qualification: all 14 themes regenerated by the real v1.1.3 renderer from 30 live samples with `NoSyntheticMetricData=true`; theme proof PASS. Compact proof PASS at 592 px and 500 px with zero recorded overflow. Current proof images/manifests are published under `docs/screenshots/themes` and `docs/screenshots/compact`.
- Sanitized acceptance record: `docs/acceptance/v1.1.3/STARTUP_RESILIENCE_ACCEPTANCE.json`.
- Immutable regression: v1.1.2 tag still `aab35e5e0e3420f3b21e8febe49bc9e2cc8bb8c0`; v1.1.2 Setup SHA256 still `25744A0A0F78B787A5FC3601577748B80353ADC9DAFB9FE91A111A53C56216FB`.
- Signing: v1.1.3 remains UNSIGNED unless independently verifiable public-trust Authenticode evidence exists. SignPath readiness does not equal provider acceptance.
- Current state: LOCAL ACCEPTANCE PASS. Public release is not yet claimed until final metadata commit, exact-head GitHub CI success, immutable tag/release creation, and remote asset digest verification complete.
- Exact next action: commit release-control docs -> determinism on exact metadata head -> non-force push branch/main -> exact-head GitHub CI -> immutable v1.1.3 release -> post-release digest/immutability seal.

## R25 / v1.1.3 PUBLIC RELEASE CLOSEOUT — 2026-09-27

- Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- Immutable release tag `v1.1.3` points exactly to `fa8c75d0b59343ccb7eae86320a351e3b4064c48`; no force push or tag rewrite was used.
- GitHub release: `https://github.com/GOD13emad/TaskbarMonitorEnhanced/releases/tag/v1.1.3`; published 2026-09-27T10:06:33Z; Latest=true; Draft=false; Prerelease=false.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions PASS on both pushed refs: main run `36311195266` and release-branch run `36311191121`. Both passed whitespace, reproducible build, deterministic clean clone, SPDX SBOM, binary provenance attestation, Setup SBOM attestation, evidence upload and manifest gates.
- GitHub main CI artifact `10929282504`, digest `sha256:537d6d902e9b99cc6fa5c8337606a7609a52e89d22b953e1c777a74ba0dab1bc`; downloaded Main/Broker/Supervisor/Setup binaries matched the accepted local hashes 4/4 exactly.
- Public release assets: 7/7 digest+size verification PASS. Setup SHA256 `159D6995D16A549DAC35BD6EF69543A63D6675778C37012619BEFDABFD43598C`; source ZIP SHA256 `D6B3B99AEEE7B3E816D94ECE6C41F25FDF338833923AFB08A3A4B29907F227CA`.
- Published SPDX raw document SHA differs from the exact-head CI SPDX raw document because generated document namespace/time fields differ. Semantic normalization over SPDX identity/version, packages, file hashes and relationships is identical: SHA256 `2e5375bfa63263162953f2c2a7a8c98b7cc4729bbb871cc7aad9f90b3c4238a1`; semantic equivalence PASS. Exact-head CI generated and attested its own SBOM at the release commit.
- Startup resilience acceptance remains PASS: missing Run self-heal, missing recovery-shortcut self-heal, duplicate recovery early exit, StartWithWindows=false cleanup, and restoration of the user's enabled state all passed.
- Visual qualification remains PASS: 14/14 themes, 30 live samples, NoSyntheticMetricData=true; 592 px and 500 px compact proofs have zero LayoutChecks overflow.
- Accepted protected sensor layer remains `1.1.2+r21`, READY, with Broker/Supervisor hashes unchanged.
- Public-trust signing remains PENDING external provider acceptance; v1.1.3 is not claimed as SignPath-signed and may show Unknown publisher.
- Immutable v1.1.2 regression remains PASS: tag `aab35e5e0e3420f3b21e8febe49bc9e2cc8bb8c0`; Setup digest `sha256:25744a0a0f78b787a5fc3601577748b80353adc9dafb9fe91a111a53c56216fb`.
- Non-blocking CI maintenance note: GitHub reports that the pinned upload-artifact action declares Node.js 20 and is currently forced to Node.js 24. It did not fail any release gate.
- Final public acceptance record: `docs/acceptance/v1.1.3/PUBLIC_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.json`.
- Critical path for v1.1.3: CLOSED. Future public-signing work must create a separately versioned signed release and must not rewrite v1.1.3.

## POST-RELEASE CI MAINTENANCE — NODE 24 ACTION PIN

- 2026-09-27 mutation: replace pinned `actions/upload-artifact@ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02` (v4 / Node.js 20 declaration) with official `actions/upload-artifact@043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a` (v7.0.1 / Node.js 24).
- Motivation: remove the non-blocking GitHub Actions Node.js 20 deprecation annotation observed on all accepted v1.1.3 CI runs.
- Source verification: official actions/upload-artifact latest release is v7.0.1, published 2026-04-10; tag resolves directly to commit `043fb46d1a93c77aae656e7c1c64a875d1fc6a0a`; `action.yml` declares `using: node24`.
- Scope: CI workflow only. Immutable release tag `v1.1.3` and its seven assets remain unchanged.
- Validation state at mutation: PENDING exact main CI. Do not call this maintenance PASS until the new commit completes the full R21 workflow without the Node.js 20 annotation.

### NODE 24 ACTION PIN VALIDATION — PASS

- Exact maintenance commit `1fabcfc420fa996cc2e7e44a4182d2569ddba007` completed GitHub Actions run `36311950294` successfully.
- Full R21 workflow passed: whitespace, reproducible build, deterministic clean clone, SPDX SBOM, binary provenance attestation, Setup SBOM attestation, evidence upload and manifest.
- The previous Node.js 20 deprecation annotation is absent on this run. The `actions/upload-artifact` v7.0.1 / Node.js 24 pin therefore resolves the known post-release CI warning.
- v1.1.3 release tag/assets remain untouched at `fa8c75d0b59343ccb7eae86320a351e3b4064c48`.
- CI maintenance Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION


## R26 / REPOSITORY HYGIENE + WORKSPACE CONSOLIDATION — 2026-09-27

- Objective: professionalize the project after v1.1.3 acceptance, reduce duplicate environments/artifacts, preserve irreplaceable evidence, and keep one canonical source workspace.
- Canonical source workspace is now `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced` on `main`.
- The former linked worktree `TaskbarMonitorEnhanced_R20` was removed from Git worktree metadata after it was reduced to tracked content only. Its now-empty directory is still held open by a running process and therefore cannot yet be deleted; it contains no project data and is not an active Git worktree.
- Historical raw evidence and network-expensive caches were MOVED, not copied, to `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\archives\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\2026-09-27_cleanup`.
- Preserved archive contents include R20/R21 raw evidence, supply-chain evidence, upstream reference cache, the pinned build dependency cache, and meaningful legacy runtime-control evidence.
- Obsolete/rebuildable local material was deleted: the 2026-09-19 preinstall backup, transient build outputs, package staging, benchmark/canary/test workspaces, duplicated runner ZIP/EXE automation stores, duplicated download-control caches, and stale atomic temp files.
- Cleanup prestate covered 2,319,268,833 bytes. Preserved archive is 392,287,771 bytes. Approximate active-storage reduction / deduplication is 1,926,981,062 bytes (~1.79 GiB).
- Active source tree after phase-1 filesystem cleanup was ~1.86 MB excluding Git metadata; installed TaskbarMonitorEnhanced root was reduced to ~69.56 MB while v1.1.3 remained running with one Main process.
- `build\_deps` is now a directory junction to the preserved central dependency cache so LibreHardwareMonitor/PawnIO do not need to be downloaded again. Pinned hashes remain:
  - LibreHardwareMonitor.zip: `086D9F1B5A99E643EDC2CFAAAC16051685B551E4C5AC0B32A57C58C0E529C001`
  - PawnIO_setup.exe: `1F519A22E47187F70A1379A48CA604981C4FCF694F4E65B734AAA74A9FBA3032`
- GitHub release hygiene: five superseded v1.1.2 RC draft releases were deleted. Published releases v1.1.2 and v1.1.3 and their immutable tags remain untouched.
- GitHub branch hygiene: 13 remote branches already merged into `main` were deleted, including obsolete audit/finalization, signing-maintenance, and completed release branches. Two unmerged historical branches were deliberately preserved because they contain unique old lineage: `fix/sensor-installer-resilience` and `release/v1.1.0`.
- v1.1.3 tag remains exactly `fa8c75d0b59343ccb7eae86320a351e3b4064c48`; v1.1.2 tag remains exactly `aab35e5e0e3420f3b21e8febe49bc9e2cc8bb8c0`.
- Obsolete RC6-RC10 self-hosted GitHub Actions workflows are being removed from current `main`; only the current general R21 CI workflow is retained for normal validation.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` is being upgraded with explicit branch, immutable-release, validation, and repository-hygiene rules.
- External cleanup evidence is retained in the archive as `CLEANUP_PRESTATE.json`, `CLEANUP_POSTSTATE_PHASE1.json`, `GITHUB_HYGIENE_PRESTATE.json`, and `GITHUB_HYGIENE_POSTSTATE.json`.
- Current open gate: commit and exact-main GitHub CI for this hygiene change. The empty locked legacy R20 directory is a non-blocking local cleanup residue only.


### R26 VALIDATION / CLOSEOUT — PASS

- Hygiene commit `f671bb4aee4dadc2f418e95c21471faa108322e7` passed exact-main GitHub Actions run `36313319634` in full: checkout, .NET setup, whitespace, reproducible build, deterministic clean clone, SPDX SBOM, binary provenance attestation, Setup SBOM attestation, evidence upload, and manifest.
- Local validation from the centralized dependency cache also passed with `Build-R21.ps1 -NoDownload`, built-in self-test, setup verification (19 resources), and deterministic clean-clone verification.
- Exact v1.1.3 Setup hash after cleanup remained `159D6995D16A549DAC35BD6EF69543A63D6675778C37012619BEFDABFD43598C`; cleanup did not mutate the published release.
- Local Git branch hygiene is complete: only `main` remains locally.
- Remote branch hygiene is intentionally conservative: `main` plus two unmerged historical branches remain; all already-merged audit/maintenance/release branches were removed.
- GitHub draft-release hygiene is complete: no draft releases remain.
- Obsolete branch-specific RC6-RC10 self-hosted workflows are removed; current validation is centralized in `.github/workflows/r21-ci.yml`.
- Current canonical source root: `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced`.
- Current preserved external archive: `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\archives\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\2026-09-27_cleanup`.
- Residual: `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\repos\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced_R20` is an empty directory only, no longer a Git worktree, but Windows reports it held open by another process. This is a cosmetic/non-blocking residue and contains zero project items.
- R26 Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION


## R27 / PUBLIC-README VISUAL + ROOT ARTIFACT CLEANUP — 2026-09-27

- User-visible audit found two residual presentation issues after R26:
  1. historical v1.1.2 RC manifests/checksum files were still cluttering the repository root;
  2. README referenced `docs/screenshots/desktops/desktop-dark-minimal.webp`, but that Git object was structurally truncated.
- The RC files are historical candidate audit records, not current release assets. They were preserved with `git mv` under `docs/acceptance/archive/v1.1.2-rc/` and documented with an archive README. Root RC artifact count is now zero.
- Corrupt WebP diagnosis is exact: RIFF header declared 62,952 bytes while the tracked Git object contained only 15,008 bytes. GitHub therefore could not decode/render it, producing the apparent blank region in README.
- The corrupt desktop WebP and its obsolete subdirectory README were removed from current `main`; no false 'real desktop capture' claim remains.
- README now uses verified live-rendered application evidence: `THEME_01_DARK_MINIMAL_PRO.png` plus the 14-theme contact sheet.
- Screenshot gallery now uses only structurally valid assets and explicitly records that the truncated historical WebP was removed.
- Validation: every Markdown image link in root README and screenshot README resolves to an existing file; all screenshot PNG/WebP assets pass structural signature/container checks; no broken image links remain.
- R27 publication gate: pending commit + exact-main GitHub CI.


## R28 / PUBLIC REPOSITORY STRUCTURE CLEANUP — 2026-09-27

- User-facing GitHub cleanup continued after R27 because historical version/revision filenames were still visible in active repository locations.
- Root policy is now: current source/docs only; historical release artifacts are grouped by version under `docs/releases/archive/`; historical acceptance evidence is grouped by version under `docs/acceptance/archive/`.
- Current v1.1.3 release notes moved from versioned root filename to `docs/releases/v1.1.3/RELEASE_NOTES.md`; the build still embeds the same canonical content under its established package-resource name, so installer payload semantics are preserved.
- Current v1.1.3 acceptance records moved to `docs/acceptance/v1.1.3/` with generic filenames.
- Historical v1.0.0–v1.1.2 release notes/manifests/checksums were moved with Git history preserved into version directories using generic filenames.
- Historical FINAL_ACCEPTANCE / R21 / R22 / RC10 public-facing filenames were moved under release-specific acceptance archive directories and renamed generically where appropriate.
- Project Brain and reusable Project Knowledge moved from the special-purpose root `00_PROJECT_CONTROL` directory into `docs/project-control/`, removing the internal control-plane folder from the public repository root.
- Added `docs/releases/README.md`, `docs/acceptance/README.md`, and `docs/project-control/README.md` as navigation/index surfaces.
- Root now contains no versioned RELEASE_MANIFEST / SHA256SUMS / historical RELEASE_NOTES filenames and no `00_PROJECT_CONTROL` directory.
- Historical JSON evidence retains original embedded release-asset/local-path labels where those fields are part of the evidence record; physical repository locations are organized without rewriting historical facts.
- Build source path updated to consume `docs/releases/v1.1.3/RELEASE_NOTES.md`; output resource name remains stable.
- Publication gate: run local no-download build + deterministic verification, then exact-main GitHub CI before accepting R28.


## R29 / ACTIVE TOOLING NAME CLEANUP + IMMUTABLE BUILD PRESERVATION — 2026-09-27

- Active engineering filenames were professionalized after the release/archive reorganization:
  - `.github/workflows/r21-ci.yml` -> `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `build/Build-R21.ps1` -> `build/Build.ps1`
  - generated `R21_BUILD_MANIFEST.json` -> `BUILD_MANIFEST.json`
  - generated `R21_SBOM.spdx.json` -> `SBOM.spdx.json`
  - CI artifact name `r21-build-evidence` -> `build-evidence`
- Determinism, contribution, installer, build and CI documentation now reference generic active names. Historical archive/evidence content keeps original revision identifiers where they are factual lineage.
- Public README was shortened to a current reliability/validation summary instead of exposing RC/R21 engineering history as the primary landing-page narrative.
- Critical immutability finding: because the installer embeds `README.md`, ordinary README cleanup initially changed the rebuilt v1.1.3 Setup hash even though executable code was unchanged.
- Prevention architecture: exact accepted embedded README bytes were extracted from the published immutable v1.1.3 Setup resource `Payload.README.md` and stored as `docs/releases/v1.1.3/INSTALLER_README.txt`.
- The build now embeds that frozen release payload snapshot while the public repository README can evolve independently.
- Frozen snapshot SHA256: `9808CC72828F1672A916EEDC6CBD8C7525169DAF5F5C5DF0500BEA9D00CFF7A1`.
- Local no-download rebuild after the freeze restored the exact published v1.1.3 Setup SHA256 `159D6995D16A549DAC35BD6EF69543A63D6675778C37012619BEFDABFD43598C`.
- Markdown-link audit after reorganization: 73 local links checked, 0 broken.
- Static hygiene: no historical release/checksum/RC files remain in repository root; no active workflow/build filenames contain Rxx/rcxx revision labels.
- Publication gate: commit reorganized tree, run deterministic clean-clone verification from exact commit, push main non-force, require exact GitHub CI PASS.


### R29 VALIDATION / CLOSEOUT — PASS

- Exact restructuring authority: commit `80f9c95afbc419bf49384d16be6f9a63d09a05d4`.
- GitHub Actions run `36315722461` at that exact head completed SUCCESS under the generic workflow name `Build and Verification`.
- CI artifact is now `build-evidence`, artifact id `10929984813`, digest `sha256:2345bb1f03c90ce270e1ec1043b029688badcfb1fb6c3d6fd3282c77f965bb43`.
- Downloaded CI evidence confirmed generic files `BUILD_MANIFEST.json` and `SBOM.spdx.json`, plus exact binary equality for Main/Broker/Supervisor/Setup.
- CI Setup SHA256 remains exactly `159D6995D16A549DAC35BD6EF69543A63D6675778C37012619BEFDABFD43598C`, identical to immutable public v1.1.3.
- Main/Broker/Supervisor CI SHA256 values remain `74E7725E...`, `182D6346...`, and `38553CCE...` respectively, matching accepted release binaries.
- GitHub API post-publication audit confirms:
  - repository root contains only current project/policy entry points and standard source directories;
  - no historical RELEASE_MANIFEST / SHA256SUMS / versioned RELEASE_NOTES / RC manifest files remain in root;
  - `docs/` top-level contains only organized category directories plus `AMD_INTEL_GPU_PORTABILITY.md`;
  - active workflow surface contains only `.github/workflows/ci.yml`;
  - active build surface uses `build/Build.ps1` and generic helper names.
- Markdown relative-link audit: 74 local links checked, zero broken.
- R29 Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION


## R30 / FINAL PUBLIC-TREE CLEANUP — 2026-09-27

- Scope: remove all obsolete release-candidate/versioned artifact filenames from the active `main` tree while preserving historical recoverability.
- Historical repository archives under `docs/releases/archive/` and `docs/acceptance/archive/` were removed from active `main`. Before removal, 42 files / 97,431 bytes were copied to:
  `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\archives\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\2026-09-27_cleanup\repository_history_removed_from_main`
  with `ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.json` SHA256 `FE6D1A1A9385D9CF5B0B8593A4899C571B4FED3EA0B50005650255F9FE44A018`.
- Historical public evidence also remains recoverable from immutable Git history, release tags, and GitHub Releases. No published tag or release asset was modified.
- `docs/AMD_INTEL_GPU_PORTABILITY.md` moved to `docs/hardware/GPU_PORTABILITY.md`; `docs/` top-level is now category-only.
- Current `docs/releases/README.md` and `docs/acceptance/README.md` describe only the current release plus GitHub/Git history as the historical authority; no local historical-archive links remain.
- Active root/path hygiene audit: zero tracked filenames matching obsolete RC/revision/versioned artifact patterns (`RC_MANIFEST`, versioned `SHA256SUMS`/`RELEASE_MANIFEST`/`RELEASE_NOTES`, `FINAL_ACCEPTANCE_v*`, `Build-R21`, `r21-ci`, `R21_*`, `R22_*`).
- Repository root contains only current standard project/policy files and source directories.
- Markdown relative-link audit: 62 links checked, 0 broken.
- Local build after cleanup: PASS with `build/Build.ps1 -NoDownload`, 0 warnings/errors, Setup verify PASS 19/19, self-test PASS, deterministic clean-clone PASS.
- Immutable v1.1.3 Setup SHA256 after cleanup remains exactly `159D6995D16A549DAC35BD6EF69543A63D6675778C37012619BEFDABFD43598C`.
- Current generated evidence names remain generic: `BUILD_MANIFEST.json` and `SBOM.spdx.json`.
- Publication gate: commit/push this final tree cleanup and require exact-head GitHub CI PASS before declaring R30 closed.


### R30 VALIDATION / CLOSEOUT — PASS

- Final public-tree cleanup authority commit: `ce94e70a170abdfeb6b5c4491c9cebd7d029639c`.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run `36317306947` completed SUCCESS under `Build and Verification`.
- CI passed checkout, SDK setup, whitespace, reproducible build, deterministic clean-clone build, SPDX SBOM, binary provenance attestation, Setup SBOM attestation, evidence upload, and manifest output.
- Active `main` contains zero obsolete RC/revision/versioned artifact filenames matching the cleanup deny-list; root and `docs/` top level are category-oriented and current-release focused.
- Historical release/acceptance records removed from active `main` remain preserved in the external hashed archive and in immutable Git history/tags/GitHub Releases.
- Remaining two historical unmerged remote branches were preserved before deletion in a complete Git bundle:
  `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\archives\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\2026-09-27_cleanup\historical_unmerged_branches.bundle`
  SHA256 `736C13A830F6440D8BF972A39556798D0028ABE1442F739AA00E4FDFD3F18948`.
- Bundled branch tips:
  - `fix/sensor-installer-resilience` -> `db9a24e4f334ea5c30ab09f16fe31092fc22311e`
  - `release/v1.1.0` -> `c800eeefc89b1fba2d94c1aeb21555ac88e3f014`
- After bundle verification, both historical remote branches were deleted. Remote branch surface is now only `main`.
- Immutable public release tags remain unchanged, including `v1.1.3` -> `fa8c75d0b59343ccb7eae86320a351e3b4064c48`.

## R31 / v1.2.0 MODERN SETTINGS + THEME LIBRARY — CANDIDATE CURRENT AUTHORITY — 2026-09-27

This section supersedes older current-state/next-action sections where they conflict. Published v1.1.3 remains immutable and accepted; this section describes the new unreleased candidate only.

- Candidate identity: `1.2.0 / V1_2_0_R01_MODERN_SETTINGS_THEME_LIBRARY / 1.2.0+r01`.
- Working branch: `feature/modern-settings-theme-library`.
- Public Stable/Latest remains immutable `v1.1.3`; no v1.2.0 tag/release has been created.
- Main mutation objectives:
  1. Settings-open hover flyout must never open/remain stuck.
  2. Settings UX modernized without replacing the proven WinForms/runtime architecture.
  3. Theme library doubled from 14 to 28 with seven additional renderer families rather than palette-only duplication.
- Hover root cause: Settings stopped `hoverTimer`, but overlay `MouseEnter/MouseMove` still called `HandleHardwareHover`; a flyout opened during Settings therefore lacked the watchdog that normally dismisses it.
- Hover fix: Settings-open guards now hide any visible flyout, reset hover identity state, and return before hover resolution; the watchdog has the same defensive guard.
- Hover regression: `--hoverguardproof` = PASS with `MOVE_SUPPRESSED=TRUE WATCHDOG_SUPPRESSED=TRUE FLYOUT_HIDDEN=TRUE`.
- Settings redesign: left navigation, page title/subtitle header, dark surfaces, consistent flat controls, fixed action bar, and live theme preview. Existing eight functional pages and data/config semantics are preserved.
- Settings visual proof: PASS 8 pages at 1080x760 after correcting an initial proof-harness false positive. A form that was only `CreateControl()`-initialized produced blank DrawToBitmap output; prevention is to actually Show the form off-screen, process layout/paint events, then capture.
- Theme library: 28 themes total. New themes: Aurora Borealis, Solarized Luxe, Arctic Frost, Sakura Night, Matrix Grid, Desert Sand, Royal Amethyst, Ocean Depth, Copper Industrial, Nordic Light, Ember Forge, Synthwave Sunset, Quantum Violet, Monochrome Paper.
- New renderer families: `aurora`, `luxe`, `zen`, `synth`, `matrix`, `paper`, `industrial`.
- Theme proof: PASS 28/28 from live telemetry; no synthetic metric data; manifest SHA256 `6791C6C44CA3FC7B547282E87864D7EF564BC70A02CAAB5C78A605533F47C304`.
- Compact proof: PASS 28 themes at 592 and 500 px; 252 layout checks; overflow count 0; manifest SHA256 `0D6DEB7547BD218A96A5E264C12F2FFCF692E24453EE75BF3F8C7367D7928138`.
- Settings proof manifest SHA256: `5163A4D6CE85500A959DA8A72081CA8A67B993A4B8DDE52E18DE55E5BD2A588A`.
- Full local Build.ps1 -NoDownload: PASS; Main/Broker/Supervisor/Setup 0 warnings/errors; sensor windowless PE PASS; canonical text payload PASS; Setup /verify PASS 19/19; self-test PASS.
- Current candidate hashes from `artifacts/BUILD_MANIFEST.json`:
  - Main `B90211E86AAF0AB05C3B87E2D2056A59B2D6369FCAD0ADCC8072A513FCB489D9`
  - Broker `182D634616434AECADD3A9AF54A746BB61FD70EC0F788DC12429679AA197D833` (unchanged accepted sensor layer)
  - Supervisor `38553CCE30D5D3F1A22AC6765C4A0F5D4D204970A3DAD7BA9467A326235FC196` (unchanged accepted sensor layer)
  - Setup `3196986C62FC7D9A91500B0E3246D5640E6292D0ED1722F736505A4DD511B3CF`
- Preserved sensor architecture: `1.1.2+r21`; Setup verify explicitly reports `REUSE_ACCEPTED_1_1_2_R21`.
- External candidate evidence root: `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\archives\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\2026-09-27_v1.2.0-candidate-evidence`.
- Evidence-backed completed: source implementation, compile, full local build, Setup resource verify, self-test, hover guard regression, theme visual proof, compact overflow proof, Settings 8-page proof.
- Open gates: commit exact candidate; clean-clone determinism; SPDX SBOM against candidate commit; live installed-main runtime/UAT on the PC; exact-head GitHub CI. Public v1.2.0 publication is explicitly deferred and not authorized by this candidate state.
- Current blocker: none technical before commit/determinism. Publication remains an irreversible later gate.
- Exact next action: commit the candidate with this Brain/Knowledge state, run clean-clone determinism and SBOM on that exact commit, then perform a reversible user-level Main deployment while preserving the protected sensor layer and verify live Settings/hover/theme behavior.

## R31B / v1.2.0 INSTALLED + PUBLIC-DOC EVIDENCE — 2026-09-27

- Code authority commit remains `5fef3787979277be30fd79c810e9f0fdeb2a653b` for the v1.2.0 implementation.
- Exact installed Main is already the candidate binary: ProductVersion `1.2.0+r01`, SHA256 `B90211E86AAF0AB05C3B87E2D2056A59B2D6369FCAD0ADCC8072A513FCB489D9`.
- Installed Apps registry reports `DisplayVersion=1.2.0`.
- Installed `Uninstall.exe` SHA256 is `3196986C62FC7D9A91500B0E3246D5640E6292D0ED1722F736505A4DD511B3CF`, exactly matching the candidate Setup.
- Installed `install_state.json`: SensorLayerStatus=READY, SensorLayerVersion=`1.1.2+r21`, SensorLayerMode=`CURRENT_EXACT_1_1_2`, MainLaunchMode=`LAUNCHED_NON_ELEVATED_SETUP`.
- Protected Broker/Supervisor hashes remain exactly accepted:
  - Broker `182D634616434AECADD3A9AF54A746BB61FD70EC0F788DC12429679AA197D833`
  - Supervisor `38553CCE30D5D3F1A22AC6765C4A0F5D4D204970A3DAD7BA9467A326235FC196`
- Installed health probe stdout: PASS with `R21=True JOB=True RESILIENCE=STABLE SUP=True CPU=True/True GPU=True/True STORAGE=True/True`.
- Installed hover regression: PASS with move/watchdog suppression and hidden flyout.
- Start-with-Windows remains enabled with both HKCU Run and Startup Recovery shortcut present.
- User configuration was preserved; current config remains valid schema 3.
- Foreground GUI screenshot confirms the running taskbar monitor is visible on the Windows taskbar. Direct mouse takeover was rejected by connector policy with `GUI_TAKEOVER_NOT_AUTHORIZED`; no attempt was made to bypass that control.
- This does not invalidate the automated UI evidence: Settings proof uses a real shown/painted WinForms form and captures all 8 pages; hover behavior has a dedicated installed-binary regression.
- Public-facing screenshot gallery has been synchronized to the v1.2.0 evidence: 28 theme strips, 56 compact strips, 8 Settings pages, and generated contact sheets.
- Gallery visual review: PASS for Settings hierarchy/readability, 28-theme differentiation, and 500px compact readability.
- Markdown relative-link audit: 38 Markdown files checked, 0 broken links.
- v1.2.0 candidate acceptance record added under `docs/acceptance/v1.2.0/CANDIDATE_ACCEPTANCE.json`.
- Public v1.1.3 remains immutable; no public v1.2.0 tag/release has yet been accepted at this point.
- Open critical gate: commit this documentation/evidence delta, rerun exact-head clean-clone determinism + SPDX SBOM, push branch, require exact-head GitHub CI PASS. Public release/promotion remains deferred until those gates.
- Exact next action: commit R31B documentation/evidence delta, then run exact-head build/determinism/SBOM and GitHub CI.


### R31C — i18n evidence-claim correction before PR

- Read-only pre-PR audit found 11 translated README files modified together after the prior candidate commit.
- The changes correctly advanced displayed candidate identity from 1.0.0 to 1.2.0 and theme count from 14 to 28, but also asserted that v1.2.0 itself had completed upgrade/full-uninstall/clean-install lifecycle validation.
- That lifecycle claim was not supported by current v1.2.0 evidence and was therefore rejected rather than promoted.
- The 11 translated files now state only evidence-backed candidate Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- No code, sensor binaries, installer payload, public tag or release was changed by this correction.
- Exact next action remains: commit/push this documentation-only correction, open PR to main, require exact-head GitHub CI PASS before any merge/public promotion.

- Public acceptance record: `docs/acceptance/v1.2.0/PUBLIC_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.json`.
- Installed PC state remains exact v1.2.0 Main/Setup with preserved `1.1.2+r21` protected sensor layer and R21 health STABLE.
- Feature objectives are evidence-backed complete: Settings-open hover bug fixed; Settings redesigned; themes doubled from 14 to 28; live/compact/Settings proof passed.
- Foreground manual mouse UAT remains unavailable only because connector policy returned `GUI_TAKEOVER_NOT_AUTHORIZED`; this was not bypassed. Installed deterministic hover regression and real-form Settings proof passed.
- Release signing state: unsigned / no publicly trusted Authenticode claim.
- Immutability policy: release-tag payload inputs `docs/releases/v1.2.0/RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `INSTALLER_README.txt` remain frozen after publication; post-publication status is documented elsewhere so the release build hash is not rewritten.
- Optional CI artifact ZIP download was abandoned after network stalls produced no bytes. No blind rerun was performed. Instead, GitHub's successful exact-head CI, provenance/SBOM attestations and the authoritative printed CI build manifest were used for binary hash equality.
- Evidence staging root: `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\archives\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\2026-09-27_v1.2.0-publication\assets`.
- Current DoD Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- Exact next action: commit the post-publication evidence-only delta on `main`, push, require exact-head CI success, verify release remains immutable/latest, then remove remote/local `feature/modern-settings-theme-library`.

### R31E / MERGED-BRANCH CLEANUP — PASS

- Before deleting the squash-merged feature branch, a complete Git bundle was created at:
  `C:\Users\Aa.Emad\source\archives\TaskbarMonitorEnhanced\2026-09-27_v1.2.0-publication\feature-modern-settings-theme-library.bundle`

- Remote feature branch deletion: PASS.
- Local feature branch deletion: PASS.
- Post-delete remote/local branch checks: absent as intended.
- Product/release state is unchanged; immutable `v1.2.0` remains exact release authority.
- Remaining exact next action: commit and push this post-publication documentation/evidence-only delta on `main`, require its GitHub CI PASS, then perform a final release/latest/tag/worktree audit. No product mutation remains open.

### R31F / FINAL REPOSITORY CLOSEOUT — PASS

- Post-publication documentation/evidence authority commit: `60db90069c8eae74cddcb5d953db1f99adab1229`.

- R32 Storage defect is closed by R33 completion-contract hardening: valid fresh output is accepted independently of near-boundary worker exit; timeout is 20 s with 3 s exit grace and bounded reap. Live soak PASS: 73 samples, 5 new attempts, 0 failure samples, max 292 ms.
- R32 startup redundancy defect is closed by continuous 60 s maintenance. Live final-hash fault injections repaired primary Run in 16.1 s and recovery shortcut in 30.1 s without fallback.
- Sensor identity is explicit: R21 architecture retained; Broker protocol remains `1.1.2+r21`; hardened Supervisor build is `1.3.0+r33`. Installer exact-hash/live-health reuse gate passed and a final reinstall reused the protected layer without restarting sensor processes.
- Ten capability package accepted: temperature thresholds/hot-state accents, adaptive battery polling, Session Pause/Resume, configurable history, Copy Diagnostics, Support ZIP, Safe Defaults, live health badge, plus dedicated Alerts Settings page.
- Privacy/reliability hardening: support manifest omits machine name and absolute source paths; Safe Defaults backup helper is preservation-tested and collision-safe.
- GPU native fault review: worker isolation plus bounded backoff 5/15/30/60/120/300 s is retained; no destructive driver-level validation was used.

## R33F / FINAL REPOSITORY CLOSEOUT — 2026-10-02

- Post-publication evidence/documentation commit: `10e8bfdbe4f4c62262b756c0b7dd396c1dfde539`.
- Exact-head GitHub Actions run `36982325715`: SUCCESS.
- That CI run again reproduced the immutable release binary hashes 4/4 and recreated provenance + Setup SBOM attestations.
- Merged temporary branches `r33-final-hardening` and `release/v1.3.0-r33` were deleted only after ancestor guard PASS; local R33 branch was also deleted.
- Remote branch surface after cleanup: only `main`.
- v1.3.0 release remains Latest, public, non-draft, non-prerelease, immutable, seven assets, exact tag commit `fc5619d049de4a95cb23542a8c3318e12f064691`.
- Live health closeout: `TBME_HEALTH_PROBE=PASS R21=True JOB=True RESILIENCE=STABLE SUP=True CPU=True/True GPU=True/True STORAGE=True/True`.

- Open product blockers/gates: none.
- Deferred external item only: publicly trusted Authenticode signing remains unproven; no trusted-signature claim is made.
- This Brain-finalization commit is documentation-only. Its external exact-head CI result is the final control verifier; once green, no additional repository mutation is required for v1.3.0.
- Exact next action: none for v1.3.0 product/release. Future work must start as a new scoped change set from `main` without mutating the immutable v1.3.0 tag/release.

## R34 / v1.3.1 REAL THEME PREVIEW — 2026-10-02

- Replaced synthetic palette preview with actual taskbar renderer preview in Display Settings.
- Runtime preview uses active Overlay snapshot + history; changing Theme redraws immediately.
- Off-screen render no longer mutates live OverlayForm size; render width is passed explicitly to layout selection.
- Installed proof and tracked Settings screenshot show live CPU/RAM/Disk/GPU/VRAM/Network data and real graphs.
- Release commit: `6e1edfe0f89ea9981360b904dd93fc198d891f04`; CI `36986831343` SUCCESS; release id `401668211`; 7/7 assets verified.
- Exact hashes: Main `8009574BD5FBB44FC699476149F8F5315BA99D2045F3884F629D550B1FA3BBCF`; Setup `67CC88D429FFA9E8D17609ECF8814CF6ABF2C70979B10BB1840071A1AC5FDF26`.
- Sensor binaries unchanged from v1.3.0.
- Signing remains UNSIGNED_PENDING_EXTERNAL_PROVIDER.

## R35 / v1.4.0 WINDOWS INTEGRATION & ACCESSIBILITY — 2026-10-02

- Search/audit-driven scope focused on Windows integration, accessibility, update security and diagnostics rather than adding unrelated feature volume.
- PerMonitorV2 DPI is supplied through deployed `TaskbarMonitorEnhanced.exe.config`; dedicated CI provenance attests that runtime configuration.
- Taskbar target policy supports primary/discovered secondary taskbars, shares one selector across placement/recovery/shell paths and falls back safely to primary when a configured target disappears.
- Current host inventory: one 3440×1440 monitor at 96 DPI and one `Shell_TrayWnd`; physical two-monitor proof is unavailable and explicitly not claimed.
- Follow-Windows light/dark maps Windows app appearance to user-selected built-in themes and reacts to user-preference notifications.
- High Contrast uses Windows system colors. Settings proof checks 143 controls with zero style gaps.
- Accessibility metadata proof checks 67 interactive controls with zero accessible-name gaps; Ctrl+1…Ctrl+9, Ctrl+S and F5 shortcuts are supported.
- Automatic update acceptance now requires canonical repository tag/release/setup URLs, blocks draft/prerelease/reparse-point installers and re-hashes the installer immediately before launch.
- Process DLL search is hardened with `SetDefaultDllDirectories(LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DEFAULT_DIRS)`.
- Privacy-safe `last_crash.json` redacts user-profile/TBME data paths and is included in user-initiated support bundles when present.
- Candidate suite 9/9 PASS; post-install suite 10/10 PASS; health/shell/Start/hardware/temperature regression PASS.
- Exact release commit `924b9bd140b531733c08ca6297d3f8beedc8bb18`; release branch CI `36998041954`; main CI `37000835504`; both SUCCESS.
- GitHub Release id `401760081`; immutable/latest; seven assets; Setup SHA256 `7d528911113c6be86a42aa6174957d85367d5b8d8f607c66f46d6e42e349fd6a`.
- Product DoD: COMPLETE / FINAL_PUBLIC_RELEASE_ACCEPTED.
- Temporary release branch `release/v1.4.0-r35` was deleted after ancestor guard PASS; remote branch surface is now only `main`. This documentation/evidence commit is the final repository mutation for v1.4.0. Its exact-head CI is the final external control verifier; once green, no further v1.4.0 mutation is required.


## R36 / v1.5.0 ACTIONABLE ALERTS & SESSION EXPORT — CANDIDATE

- Previous accepted state: immutable v1.4.0 public release on main.
- Current delta: Main/UI-only candidate adds optional temperature notifications with 3 C hysteresis + 10-minute lane cooldown, bounded 3,600-sample session CSV export, and Open Task Manager quick action.
- Protected sensor authority unchanged: Broker 1.1.2+r21; Supervisor 1.3.0+r33; no sensor source mutation in R36.
- Benchmark/method choice: existing WinForms NotifyIcon is reused per Microsoft platform documentation; no Windows App SDK dependency or plugin framework added because those would increase architecture/deployment cost without being required for the identified gap.
- Pre-commit gates: app compile 0 warnings/0 errors PASS; selftest PASS; feature-contract selftest PASS; full Build.ps1 -NoDownload PASS and Setup 1.5.0 produced.
- Determinism pre-commit run: INVALID/EXPECTED FAIL because verifier clones committed HEAD (v1.4.0) while R36 was uncommitted. Root cause confirmed; rerun required after candidate commit.
- Current Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- Open gates: exact-commit determinism, candidate proof suite, live install with sensor-layer reuse, installed runtime regression, GitHub CI/provenance, immutable release asset verification.
- Exact next action: commit R36 candidate, rerun clean-clone determinism on that exact commit, then continue through runtime/release gates.

- R36 determinism defect: Setup-only mismatch traced to missing EOL policy for installer/setup.manifest; minimum fix is LF pin in .gitattributes. Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION

- R36 live-install gate: FAIL due stale install_state Version/PublicVersion=1.4.0 despite deployed Main 1.5.0. Root cause confirmed as two installer hardcodes; narrow fix applied. Rebuild/determinism/reinstall pending.


## R36 milestone — LOCAL CANDIDATE ACCEPTED / GITHUB CI NEXT

- Local release gates are green: reproducible build PASS, clean-clone determinism PASS, candidate 11/11, installed/postinstall 11/11, installed hashes 5/5 exact, config migration preservation PASS, health STABLE.
- v1.5.0 is installed on the validation host with exact current Main/Setup hashes and unchanged protected sensor pair (Broker 1.1.2+r21, Supervisor 1.3.0+r33).
- Authority remains CANDIDATE; v1.4.0 remains public Latest.
- Critical path: release-branch exact-head CI/provenance -> main exact-head CI/provenance -> immutable v1.5.0 tag/assets/digests/public acceptance.
- Exact next action: commit acceptance records and push release/v1.5.0-r36.


## FINAL — v1.5.0 PUBLIC RELEASE / CURRENT AUTHORITY

- Final objective reached for R36: v1.5.0 Actionable Alerts & Session Export is published as the immutable GitHub Latest release.
- Release authority: tag v1.5.0 -> d952a87fab02fe74046b8d19ae14a2801d6da644; release ID 401880404; immutable=true; 7/7 asset digest verification PASS.
- Product gates: build 0 warnings/0 errors; reproducible build PASS; deterministic clean clone PASS; candidate 11/11; installed/postinstall 11/11; installed hashes 5/5; migration preservation PASS; final health STABLE.
- CI/provenance gates: release-branch run 37017612215 PASS; main run 37018027405 PASS on the same exact SHA; binary/runtime-config provenance and Setup SBOM attestation PASS.
- Protected sensor authority unchanged: Broker 1.1.2+r21; Supervisor 1.3.0+r33.
- Public signing: UNSIGNED_PENDING_EXTERNAL_PROVIDER; no public-trust signature claim.
- Previous authority: v1.4.0 remains immutable.
- Current Project Brain Status: CURRENT_LOCAL_CANDIDATE_VERIFICATION
- Open blocker for v1.5.0 product finalization: NONE. External optional future gate only: publicly trusted Authenticode provider.
- Exact next action for future development: branch from immutable v1.5.0/main baseline; do not mutate v1.5.0 tag/assets.


## R39 / v1.7.0 WALLPAPER STUDIO + SEKIRO — SOURCE CANDIDATE PASS — 2026-10-05

- Previous accepted state is preserved: immutable v1.6.0/R38, product source `1652989b80c5c6d301c6f05818c48c5207fd9b7a`, installed Main SHA-256 `05F9E069C4598FDAD327A41BF1CA34A1498D022119DB81E09F4B3B091C9BA377`.
- R39 source authority: branch `feature/v1.7.0-wallpaper-studio`, commit `ed46152eb9d9ff326687ba5038aa0990e03102d0`.
- Current objective delta: 21 Studio themes including Sekiro; exactly 10 wallpapers per Studio theme; 210 wallpapers total. Total theme catalog is 49.
- Implementation: deterministic procedural PNG generation tied to theme palette/geometry; wallpaper preview; single/export-all; guarded desktop apply with saved wallpaper/style/tile pre-state and rollback attempt. No copied Sekiro/game artwork is bundled.
- Verification: build 0 warnings/0 errors PASS; main selftest PASS 49/21/210; workspace selftest PASS 49/21/210; themeproof PASS 49; wallpaperproof PASS 210/210 unique before and after the final safety/resource patch.
- Post-quality wallpaper proof authority: `.local/r39/wallpaperproof_postquality/WALLPAPER_PROOF_MANIFEST.json`, SHA-256 `1D36FED74044C202AA209536F5301BD34F2C4860689927CE1BD0113999C114EC`.
- Representative pixel review PASS: Sekiro variants 01/05/10 plus Art Deco Gold variant 04.
- System safety: no live wallpaper apply, no rapid theme loop, no install, no reboot. AnyDesk and installed TBME/sensor processes remain active; keyboard/GUI input is available; installed v1.6 Main hash unchanged; R39 did not create the live Wallpapers directory.
- Failure controls: brittle patch quoting/line-ending failure, nested-shell variable expansion, WinExe `$LASTEXITCODE` false-negative, and stale 1.6 version assertion were root-caused and converted to guarded file-based patching, Process.ExitCode verification, and version-contract regression. Superseded failed runners must not be replayed as authority.
- Current status: `CURRENT_R39_CANDIDATE / SOURCE_CANDIDATE_PASS_NOT_RELEASED`.
- Completed this revision: authority audit -> pre-state backups -> isolated branch -> source implementation -> build -> functional regression -> pixel proof -> quality patch -> post-quality proof -> host safety regression -> source candidate commit.
- Open blocker / critical path: packaging/installer/build scripts still identify/package v1.6.0. R39 source must not be installed or published as v1.7 until that single packaging change-set passes package/determinism gates.
- Current control: `docs/project-control/CURRENT_PROJECT.json`.
- Candidate acceptance: `docs/acceptance/v1.7.0/R39_SOURCE_CANDIDATE_ACCEPTANCE.json`.
- Exact next action: ONE change-set for v1.7.0 packaging/installer integration, including WallpaperStudio source/payload; then build and deterministic package verification without installation. Promotion remains prohibited until those gates pass.


## R40 / v1.7.0 DETERMINISTIC PACKAGE — ACCEPTED CANDIDATE — 2026-10-05

- Previous authority remains immutable v1.6.0/R38; it was not installed over, retagged or republished.
- R39 product source: `ed46152eb9d9ff326687ba5038aa0990e03102d0`.
- R40 packaging authority: `2cb0baadb127c4b9e8090670d51905ffd2e29627`.
- Package integration is complete for v1.7.0: WallpaperStudio canonical source is embedded/extracted, Setup identity/resources/release docs are v1.7, Setup verification contract is 25 resources, and new source EOL is deterministic.
- Full exact-head build PASS 0 warnings/0 errors; Setup `/verify` PASS; embedded WallpaperStudio bytes match canonical package text.
- Setup candidate SHA-256: `58E844297A0B33E52F05D5023408DB159275BAECDB5C1627DBAEA990CF1237AF`.
- Exact-head clean-clone determinism PASS.
- Visual candidate acceptance PASS 8/8, including workspace proof and 210/210 unique wallpaper proof.
- No install or live wallpaper apply occurred in R40; installed v1.6 remains the runtime authority.
- R40 patch-generation quoting failure was fail-safe before mutation and is superseded by guarded literal patch R40B; do not replay R40 failed patch scripts as authority.
- Current status: `CURRENT_R40_PACKAGE_CANDIDATE / ACCEPTED_NOT_INSTALLED_NOT_RELEASED`.
- Current control: `docs/project-control/CURRENT_PROJECT.json`.
- Acceptance: `docs/acceptance/v1.7.0/R40_PACKAGE_CANDIDATE_ACCEPTANCE.json`.
- Exact next action: R41 single controlled live canary only — capture exact wallpaper/style/tile + AnyDesk/GUI pre-state, apply one Sekiro wallpaper from the exact candidate, verify, restore exact pre-state, then regression-check host stability. No install until R41 PASS.
